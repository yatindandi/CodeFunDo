The Winter Games begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, at a time of high tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs. After talks earlier this year aimed at defusing tensions, North and South Korea agreed to field a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team and to march their athletes under one flag at the opening ceremony. Despite its decision to send athletes, North Korea announced it would celebrate the founding of its military on Feb. 8, an event generally marked with a large military parade displaying weapons like missile launchers.  \u201cWhile we would prefer that this parade not occur on Feb. 8, it is our hope, and I know the hope of South Korea, that the North Koreans ... will join with all the nations of the world in celebrating the athletes,\u201d Goldstein said.

They are assisting some 275 athletes and as many as 60,000 U.S. citizens. Colon and other officials said organizing security for the South Korea games was no different than that of other Olympics, despite the tensions with Pyongyang.

{"text": "Relations between the NATO allies have been strained by U.S. support for the YPG Kurdish militia in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group, but it is a key component of U.S.-backed forces battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey is targeting the YPG in an air and ground operation in Syria\u2019s northwest Afrin region launched two weeks ago. President Tayyip Erdogan has promised to sweep the militia from Turkey\u2019s southern border, a move that could put Turkish troops in confrontation with U.S. forces on the ground in Syria. \u201cOur trust is damaged. We have to mend our trust.

Turkish media earlier reported that Tillerson and U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster would both visit Turkey in the near future. Cavusoglu did not say when they would visit. Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union as well as by Turkey. \u201cThe United States should understand and meet our concerns,\u201d Cavusoglu said. \u201cYou are cooperating with this terror organization knowingly.

On Tuesday Erdogan repeated his demand for U.S. forces to pull back from Manbij, saying the United States was setting itself up against Turkey, Iran and possibly Russia by arming the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in a large part of northern Syria which borders Turkey.

{"text": "Top officials from the four countries will participate in the high-level meeting, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, MSC conference head Wolfgang Ischinger said. The four countries have met regularly since 2014 to try to resolve the separatist conflict, which has killed some 10,000 people. A ceasefire agreement was signed in February 2015 in Minsk but has failed to end the violence. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has canceled his participation in the Munich conference, a spokesman said on Thursday. It was not immediately clear who would represent him in the discussions on Ukraine. Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz, who is scheduled to take over as foreign minister if SPD members approve a new \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with Chancellor Angela Merkel, will address the conference, Ischinger told reporters. Ischinger welcomed plans for a meeting of the four countries as a possible way to jumpstart the long-stalled Minsk peace process. \u201cIt is good to use the opportunity in Munich to try to get some movement back into the somewhat stalled Minsk talks,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it works.\u201d Germany and France have urged the parties involved in the conflict to implement decisions already agreed, including the withdrawal of heavy equipment from front lines. The annual Munich Security Report issued in the runup to the conference called the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u201cthe most important stumbling block\u201d on the path to better relations between Russia and the West, adding that prospects for a political solution appeared dim. A decision by the United States in December to begin approving lethal arms sales to Ukraine would likely prolong the current stalemate, the report said. Ischinger told reporters it would nonetheless be useful if Washington got engaged in the Minsk process, and the same was true for the European Union.

Two U.S. senators, a Democrat and Republican, who spoke at Thornton\u2019s confirmation hearing for the post of assistant secretary for East Asia, said they and other senators had been told by senior White House officials on Wednesday that there was no such strategy.

The foreign ministers of the two countries met the United Nation\u2019s special envoy Matthew Nimetz in Vienna earlier this month to discuss the issue. \u201cI believe we will be able to conclude the negotiations successfully by the NATO summit in July,\u201d Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who took over last May and pledged to work closer with Greece, said in an interview with Austrian radio station ORF. Talks between the two states have been inconclusive since 1991, when Macedonia withdrew from former Yugoslavia. It was admitted into the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Macedonia said earlier this month it was ready to add a geographical qualifier to its name to help resolve the dispute with Greece, in an effort to increase its prospects of joining the European Union and NATO. \u201cWe have an automatic invitation, meaning NATO members will start ratifying our (NATO) accession as soon as we and Greece announce that the problem has been solved,\u201d Zaev said. The NATO summit will be held on 11 and 12 July in Brussels.

Kem Ley, 46, was gunned down in broad daylight at a shop in the capital Phnom Penh on July 10, 2016. Bou Rachana, who was seven months pregnant at the time, and her four sons fled Cambodia in August 2016, fearing for their safety. Kem Ley\u2019s death drew tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets against a backdrop of growing political tension with veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen.  A Cambodian court jailed a man for life last year for killing Kem Ley. The murder case raised public suspicions of a political motive, but the convicted killer testified that he killed Kem Ley was over a debt. Human rights groups and Kem Ley\u2019s supporters remain sceptical of the motive. The family said the activist did not owe any money. Prime Minister Hun Sen has come under criticism from Western countries and rights groups for a crackdown on government opposition ahead of elections in July, at which he is expected to extend his 33-year rule. A Cambodian court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last year, following the arrest of its leader Kem Sokha on treason charges, which he says were politically motivated. Exiled Cambodian opposition figure Sam Rainsy has raised the prospect of violence if the election is not postponed.

The 20 Uighurs broke out of a cell near the Thai-Malaysian border in November by digging holes in a wall and using blankets as ladders. Five were recaptured in Thailand later that month. The escapees were part of a larger group of more than 200 Uighurs detained in Thailand in 2014.

{"text": "The man, John Ausonius, went on a racially motivated spree in Sweden in 1991 and 1992 in which he killed one person and injured 10 others in attacks in the Stockholm area, for which he is already serving a life sentence in Sweden. Dubbed the \u201claser man\u201d by Swedish media for his use of a laser sight and rifle for some of the shootings, he is thought to have inspired anti-immigrant attacks such as the 2011 massacre by Norwegian Anders Breivik and shootings by Peter Mangs in Sweden. While on the run from authorities after the shootings in Sweden, Ausonius, now 64, was suspected of shooting dead a woman in broad daylight in Frankfurt in 1992. He had accused the 68-year-old woman of stealing an electronic notebook from his coat pocket in the cloakroom of the Frankfurt hotel in which she worked, German prosecutors have said. Ausonius has denied killing the woman but did not object to being transferred to Germany for the murder trial on condition he serves any possible prison sentence in Sweden. The state court in Frankfurt on Wednesday sentenced him to life in prison followed by preventative detention, a court spokesman said. He was not immediately able to provide further details.
