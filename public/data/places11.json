The pastor and his wife, Norine Brunson, were initially detained on immigration violation charges in October, when they were operating a small Christian church in the city of Izmir on Turkey\u2019s western coast, media reports say. Turkish media reports say Brunson has been charged with membership of the Gulenist Terror Organisation, the term which Turkish authorities uses to refer to the network of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara accuses Gulen and his followers of being behind an attempted coup in Turkey last July. Gulen rejects the allegations. Tillerson was in Ankara to meet Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and senior government ministers for talks which focused on the conflict in neighboring Syria. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a joint news conference with Tillerson that Ankara expected Washington to take concrete steps on the extradition of Gulen, calling for his detention in the United States.

Two North Koreans based in China and one North Korean based in Cuba were blacklisted for ties to Korea Ryonbong General Corporation, a previously sanctioned company that \u201cspecializes in acquisition for North Korean defense industries and support to Pyongyang\u2019s military-related sales,\u201d the statement said. Another worked for a North Korean trading company in Dalian, China, the U.S. Treasury said. It said six North Koreans based in Vietnam, China and Russia were sanctioned for their ties to North Korean banks. One person on the sanctioned list worked as a North Korean government official who was trying to establish a cargo shipping route between North Korea and Vietnam, Treasury said. The U.S. measures on Friday block any property those on the sanctions list may have in the United States and bar Americans from dealing with them. The Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system in order to counter Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile threat, as well as increased pressure on Chinese banks and firms that do business with North Korea. The administration is conducting a broad review of North Korea policy, expected to be completed in coming weeks.

A court in January rejected a government plan to transfer the two uninhabited islands to Saudi Arabia after a maritime demarcation accord was announced in April. The accord awarded sovereignty of the islands to Saudi Arabia, even though most Egyptians believe they belong to Egypt. The decision by Egypt\u2019s Court of Urgent Matters is subject to appeal and any final deal must be approved by parliament. The latest twist in this issue came as bilateral relations appear to be warming after months of tension. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi accepted an invitation last week from Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman to visit his country in April, a move that came on the heels of the kingdom\u2019s decision to restore oil aid shipments to Egypt after a halt of about six months. The ongoing island litigation had previously been a source of unease between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which has showered Cairo with tens of billions of dollars in aid in recent years. Human rights lawyer Khaled Ali, whose case in an administrative court had nullified the agreement, said the ruling was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Urgent Matters. He described it as a way for parliament to take judicial cover while debating an accord already rejected by other courts. \u201cThe high administrative court rulings are final, and their implementation may not be stopped or nullified except by another ruling of the high administrative court,\u201d he wrote in a post on his Facebook page. Saudi and Egyptian officials had argued that the islands belonged to Saudi Arabia and were only under Egyptian control because Riyadh asked Cairo in 1950 to protect them. But lawyers who had opposed the accord said Egypt\u2019s sovereignty over the islands dated back to a treaty in 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police they intercepted a 43-year-old woman driving nine people across the U.S. border into the prairie province of Saskatchewan on Friday night. All of the asylum seekers are from West Africa but police would not give their nationalities, genders or ages. The increasing flow of hundreds of asylum seekers of African and Middle Eastern origin from the United States in recent months is becoming a contentious issue in Canada. The RCMP has intercepted more than 1,100 people walking into Canada in the first two months of 2017. Michelle Omoruyi, 43, was charged with one count each of human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.  The nine people were the first intercepted in connection with alleged human smuggling, the RCMP said on Wednesday. They were transferred to the Canada Border Services Agency, processed and released. They have filed refugee claims and are living in Canada while they wait for their claims to be decided, police said.  Refugee advocates have said Canada\u2019s policy to turn back people if they make refugee claims at border crossings - a provision of the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement - increases the problem of human smuggling and unlawful border crossings.      \u201cUnfortunately one of the effects of the Safe Third Country Agreement is to provide business opportunities for smugglers, who often take advantage of the need and desperation of refugees,\u201d said Janet Dench, executive director of Canadian Council for Refugees.

At least three of those arrested were suspected of links to the Belgian suicide bombings in March of last year, which killed 31 people at the Brussels airport and on a metro train, Spain\u2019s High Court said in a statement.

Three years after Moscow annexed the Crimean region, tensions between Ukraine and separatists in the Russian-held eastern part of the country remain high and a 2015 ceasefire is violated regularly. \u201cThis night, the power supply to the temporarily occupied territory of Luhansk region was completely halted,\u201d Vsevolod Kovalchuk, head of the state power distributor Ukrenergo, said on Facebook. Local media quoted a separatist official as saying the rebel-held territory, which borders Russia, had been prepared for the suspension and would connect to other sources. Boris Gryzlov, Moscow\u2019s envoy to the long-running Ukraine peace talks, criticised the move as politically motivated and said Russia would provide power to the affected territory.   Luhansk residents told Reuters by phone that electricity supplies appeared to be working as normal.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision to cut power to the territory was \u201canother step by Ukraine on the road to rejecting territory,\u201d which has been under separatist control since 2014. Ukraine cut gas supplies to Luhansk in 2015, also blaming unpaid debts, and imposed a trade blockade on the occupied regions in March. Kiev has accused the area of accumulating 2.6 billion hryvnias ($97.67 million) in unpaid electricity charges. An American paramedic working for European security watchdog OSCE\u2019s monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine was killed and two others injured on Sunday when their vehicle struck a mine near small village of Pryshyb, closed to Luhansk.

Two witnesses came forward 10 days after the accident to say that they had heard a passenger in the car that struck the woman yelling insults afterwards, including: \u201cGo back to where you came from, then you won\u2019t get run over. Damn refugees.\u201d Nothbaum said a new investigation of possible incitement to racial hatred was launched on Wednesday. Germany has seen a sharp increase in anti-immigrant rhetoric after the influx of over a million migrants over the past two years, and officials say the growing right-wing extremist scene is also increasingly willing to commit violence. Nothbaum said there was no suggestion that the car had deliberately run over the woman. He said witnesses to the accident said it happened when she stepped off a curb into  traffic in the center of the town, near a streetcar stop. Martina Muench, education minister in the state of Brandenburg that includes Cottbus, welcomed the investigation, and said foreign students, teachers and researchers helped strengthen the competitiveness of the state. \u201cIt would be a shame if these allegations are proven true,\u201d Muench said in a statement. \u201cIt is unfathomable and appalling that a young, fatally injured woman would be insulted in such a racist and xenophobic way in the middle of Cottbus.\u201d The state education ministry said international students accounted for about 7,800, or just over 16 percent, of the state\u2019s 48,000 students, and around 620 of the state\u2019s academic staff came from overseas.
