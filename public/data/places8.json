Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation agency, said the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft operated by local company Nature Air had crashed minutes after take-off, but that officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash. The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punto Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose. Nature Air said in a statement that it lamented the accident, without explaining the cause. The flight was part of a special charter service for 20 people, relying on two planes. The first plane, carrying 10 passengers, arrived safely in San Jose at 11:40 a.m. The second, with 10 passengers and two pilots, departed 20 minutes later.   \u201cRegrettably this plane crashed a few minutes after taking off,\u201d Nature Air said.

Laura Chinchilla, who was president of Costa Rica from 2010 to 2014, said on Twitter that her cousin, one of the pilots, had died in the accident.

The family were on a short tourist flight, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, from a waterfront restaurant on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, to Rose Bay in the city\u2019s east.  A preliminary report into the crash was expected in about 30 days, with a final report taking up to 12 months, according to Australian Transport Safety Bureau executive director Nat Nagy. \u201cWe are reasonably confident that we will be able to do a thorough examination of the key components of the aircraft, to understand whether they were operating correctly at the time,\u201d Nagy told reporters. Police divers wrapped slings around the fuselage and a barge fitted with a small crane slowly lifted the wreck, upside down and without wings, from about 13 meters of water near Cowan, 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.     The propeller, cockpit and front section of fuselage were crumpled, and the landing floats were raised separately. The pieces were loaded on to the barge deck and covered with a tarpaulin, television pictures showed. Air crash investigation records, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, show a plane with the same serial number crashed 21 years earlier, when it was being used as a crop duster. The 1996 accident report found that the aircraft, a DHC-2 de Havilland Canada, likely stalled and that conditions were gusty when it crashed, killing the pilot. \u201cIt was repaired after the accident and all appropriate approvals and checks were done. It was then re-registered and went back into service,\u201d a spokesman for Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority said in an email.

The contested uninhabited islands in the East China Sea are known as the Senkaku in Japan, which controls them, and Diaoyu in China. The Japanese criticism comes after Asia\u2019s two biggest economies had pledged to improve ties.

A spokesman for Jose Antonio Meade, his rival from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), warned on Wednesday about possible Russian interference in the July vote, with the aim of benefiting Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up. The former Mexico City mayor, who is widely known as \u201cPeje\u201d after a thick-skinned fish prevalent in his home state of Tabasco, responded with a tongue-in-cheek video shot at a port, where he said he was waiting for a Russian submarine to surface laden with gold. \u201cI am no longer \u2018Peje,\u2019 now I\u2019m Andres Manuelovich,\u201d he grinned. Russia has been accused of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election won by President Donald Trump, and some in Mexico have voiced fears that the country led by Vladimir Putin could unleash Kremlin-backed hackers to sow chaos in the July vote. At a joint news conference in Moscow in November with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Mexico\u2019s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said there was no evidence Russia was trying to influence Mexico\u2019s election. Lavrov denied any interference.  In an earlier video, AMLO, as he is also known, responded to a dig from President Enrique Pena Nieto by suggesting the Mexican leader should take an \u201cAmlodipine\u201d pill, a medication for high blood pressure. Lopez Obrador, who maintains a strong lead in opinion polls, has also softened his image with videos of him at home with his wife and children, and engaged in everyday activities such as getting his haircut.   Lopez Obrador\u2019s detractors have long compared him to former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, suggesting he would seek to usher in a socialist revolution in Mexico, Latin America\u2019s No. 2 economy.

The United States has signaled an open-ended military presence in Syria as part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State\u2019s resurgence, pave the way diplomatically for the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and curtail Iran\u2019s influence. \u201cThe precision strikes were a culmination of extensive intelligence preparation to confirm an ISIS headquarters and command and control center in an exclusively ISIS-occupied location in the contested middle Euphrates River Valley,\u201d a  statement issued on Tuesday said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The strikes took place near As Shafah, Syria and killed between 145 and 150 militants. The statement added that U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Kurdish YPG fighters, helped in target observation. Turkey seeks to avoid any clash with U.S., Russian or Syrian forces but will take any steps needed for its security, a Turkish minister said on Tuesday, the fourth day of its air and ground offensive against Kurdish forces. The United States and Russia both have military forces in Syria and have urged Turkey to show restraint in its campaign, named Operation Olive Branch, to crush the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG in the Afrin region on Turkey\u2019s southern border. \u201cOur SDF partners are still making daily progress and sacrifices, and together we are still finding, targeting and killing ISIS terrorists intent on keeping their extremist hold on the region,\u201d Major General James Jarrard, commander of special operations for the coalition, said in the statement. The United States has led an international coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State since 2014. U.S. troops have served as advisers on the ground with Iraqi government forces and with Kurdish and Arab groups in Syria. The coalition has said in the past that fewer than 1,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Iraq and Syria, but that the militant group still remains a threat. The figure excludes areas in western Syria under the control of Assad\u2019s government and his allies.
