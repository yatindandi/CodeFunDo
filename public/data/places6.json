Witold Waszczykowski said the policy was a reaction to disrespect shown at a Polish cemetery in the western city of Lviv, which was part of Poland before World War Two.  The foreign ministry said lion sculptures at the cemetery\u2019s entrances that hold shields inscribed with the Polish phrases \u201cAlways faithful\u201d and \u201cTo you, Poland\u201d had been covered up with boxes.

He did not say how the policy would be applied in practice. \u201cAt the moment, we are launching procedures that will not allow people with extremely anti-Polish views to come to Poland ... Those who demonstrate and use administrative instruments against Poland will also bear the consequences,\u201d Waszczykowski told state-run TVP1 television.  Poland is home to between 1.5 million and 2 million Ukrainians who left their country seeking jobs after the 2014 Maidan uprising and conflict with pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine plunged their economy into recession. Despite Poland\u2019s support for an independent Ukraine that can stand up to Russia, tensions over the countries\u2019 troubled shared history have risen since the Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in Poland two years ago. Poland last year passed a resolution that declared the World War Two-era killing of tens of thousands of Poles by units in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) \u201cgenocide\u201d.

A report sent to the United Nations Security Council last week concluded that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government was responsible for the attack, which prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base. Russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the Syrian army, said at the time there was no evidence to show Damascus was responsible and the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad\u2019s government. On Thursday, with the aid of maps, satellite footage and charts, Moscow set out why it believed the Syrian government had been unfairly maligned.    A Russian Defence Ministry official told a media briefing that the Syrian Su-22 jet accused of dropping the chemical bomb was not physically close enough to the attack site to have been involved. \u201cThus, I believe the information provided cannot confirm the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun in the form of an aviation bomb dropped from a Syrian Air Force Su-22 jet,\u201d the RIA news agency quoted the official, whom it did not name, as saying. Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s Department for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control, told the same briefing that U.S. accusations that Russia had encouraged the use of chemical weapons in Syria were ungrounded, RIA reported. \u201cIt was hysteria and a completely open attempt to discredit Russia with rather primitive dirty means,\u201d Ulyanov was quoted as saying. The White House on Wednesday admonished Russia after it vetoed a United Nations plan to continue its ongoing investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country\u2019s more than six-year civil war.

For at least two decades, the goal of U.S.-led diplomacy has been a \u2018two-state solution\u2019, meaning an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side and at peace with Israel.  But neither Trump nor his aides have publicly recommitted to a two-state solution, instead saying it is up to the two parties to work out in peace talks. Asked during a visit to London to commemorate the 1917 British declaration of support for a Jewish homeland if he felt now was the moment for peace in the region, noting Trump\u2019s involvement in peace efforts, he said: \u201cHope so.\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s being discussed now is an American initiative. Obviously we make our interests and our concerns known to Mr Trump. He\u2019s coming with a sort of refreshing \u2018can-do\u2019 thing... they\u2019re trying to think out of the box,\u201d Netanyahu said at London\u2019s Chatham House think-tank. Netanyahu has previously expressed doubts about the Trump initiative, telling France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron in July that it would be difficult to move forward quickly because he felt Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas may not be able to deliver on commitments he had made. But he said that more countries in the region were now beginning to engage constructively with Israel. \u201cThe reason I draw hope from the moment is because of the larger shift in Arab-Israeli relations with the countries of the region. I cannot emphasize how dramatic that is,\u201d he said.

The three-page paper, to be considered by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens later on Friday, mapped out broad agreement on a pragmatic approach to foreign policy, multilateralism and a strong commitment to global trade. \u201cWe want to strengthen the diplomatic resources of Germany, putting a priority on civilian crisis prevention, active crisis management and long-term stabilization,\u201d the paper said. It said the parties were committed to ridding the world of nuclear weapons and would launch a new diplomatic drive for nuclear disarmament, pushing for a more European approach on many issues. It gave a nod to the Greens by saying the parties agreed to take a \u201crestrictive\u201d approach to weapons exports, and would push for a joint European arms export policy.  The paper also underscored the importance of global trade and called for efforts to strengthen the central role of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It said the prospective coalition government would maintain close ties to the U.S. administration, but would also seek to expand ties with U.S. state governments and cities. Many of those entities have said they will defy a decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The paper also contained several bracketed sentences that had not yet been agreed, including a proposal by the Greens to withdraw the NATO nuclear weapons that remain on German soil, and to ban all weapons sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen. The parties also remain at odds over the use of armed drones and over foreign military missions, the draft document showed. Also missing from the draft is any mention of the NATO target of moving toward spending 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense by 2024. Officials close to the talks say the target should not be included in the coalition agreement since the target date is well beyond the four-year scope of the deal.

A new and little-known group called Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for the October attack, posing a new threat to Egyptian security forces, which have been battling an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai peninsula since 2013. The military last month killed 15 militants in an air raid directed at the group it blamed for the desert attack, according to the Interior Ministry, which said that all of those killed had been trained in Derna.

At least 147 have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army, with Russian air power, began the offensive to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta nearly two weeks ago. The area of densely-populated agricultural land is the last major territory near the capital still held by rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. Across Syria, fighters have been driven out of most towns and cities in the past two years since Russia joined the war on Assad\u2019s behalf. Eastern Ghouta is also one of several \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease fighting. Russia proposed imposing a ceasefire in the de-escalation zone for Tuesday and Wednesday, Interfax news agency reported, quoting the Defence Ministry. \u201cSuch measures will ease tension in the western part of the de-escalation zone,\u201d General-Lieutenant Sergei Kuralenko, in charge of Russia\u2019s ceasefire monitoring center in Syria, was quoted as saying.

Residents are so short of food that they are eating trash, fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a report last week. On Monday, 13 shells hit government-held Damascus and its surrounding areas, Syrian state media SANA reported. Four people were injured from a shell that hit the capital on Sunday, SANA said.

A month after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited South Sudan and met with President Salva Kiir in the capital Juba, she told the U.N. Security Council: \u201cWords are no longer sufficient.\u201d \u201cThe United States is prepared to pursue additional measures against the government \u2013 or any party, for that matter \u2013 if they do not act to end the violence and ease the suffering in South Sudan,\u201d said Haley, who was the most senior member of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to visit South Sudan. The Trump administration imposed sanctions in September on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the civil war and attacks against civilians.  However, any U.S. push for the U.N. Security Council to take further action against South Sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power Russia. The council sanctioned several senior South Sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015, but a U.S. bid to impose an arms embargo in December 2016 failed.  \u201cIt is counterproductive to impose targeted sanctions, counterproductive to impose an arms embargo, such measures will not help to break this deadlock and will only further exacerbate the crisis,\u201d Russia\u2019s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Petr Iliichev. South Sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. The conflict was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer, who is being held in South Africa. A fragile peace deal in South Sudan broke down last year and East African bloc IGAD has been trying to revive it.  \u201cWe view as unjust the ongoing attempts to place all blame for the persistent unabated violence on Juba alone, it has done its role, now the opposition must reciprocate,\u201d Iliichev said.  U.N. sanctions monitors reported earlier this month that despite the catastrophic conditions across South Sudan, armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to \u201cactively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.\u201d ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-94.3664964957136, 40.25223354552732]}}, "geometry": {"coordinates": [107.70683310391571, 65.47537172271952]}, "countries": ["Russia", "United States"], "title": "29-11-2017 : U.S. threatens South Sudan action, Russia warns against U.N. measures (Russia-United States)"},

The arrest of eight men and a woman in early-morning raids at three locations in central Athens on Tuesday came days before an expected state visit by Tayyip Erdogan, the first by a Turkish president to Greece in 65 years. Greece says the two events are unrelated.  Police officials said they were being questioned for alleged links to the leftist DHKP/C, a far-left group blamed for a string of attacks and suicide bombings in Turkey since 1990.  Their lawyer said the individuals, who have not been named, were \u2018struggling against a fascist regime\u2019 and had denied any wrongdoing.  They were charged with setting up and being members of a criminal organization, terrorist-related acts of supply and possession of explosive materials, illegal possession of firearms, smoke bombs and fire crackers, court sources said. The individuals, escorted handcuffed into a central Athens court wearing bullet proof vests, have not entered a formal plea.  \u201cThey are refugees,\u201d lawyer Alexandra Zorbala said. \u201cSome have sought, others have received asylum ... they are fighters who are struggling against a fascist regime, against torture and thousands of arrests.\u201d . One of the charges they face is resisting arrest. At least one of the defendants entered the courthouse with a black eye. One of the detainees had been wanted by Greek police in connection with an arms and explosives haul off the Greek island of Chios, close to the Turkish coast, in 2013.    Turkey\u2019s Erdogan is widely expected to visit Greece in December, although his visit has not been officially announced.
