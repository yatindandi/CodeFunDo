With another 20,000 people currently trapped in no-man\u2019s land between the two countries, they expect more people to cross the border than during the crisis in the fall of last year, when more than 70,000 people made the journey. They say funding for enough rice to feed all the people who have crossed since October \u201cmay be problematic\u201d. - Aid workers\u2019 data shows that some 40 percent of the people who have crossed in August were very young, aged 4-14 years old. They fear lack of accommodation and sanitation facilities may lead to abuse of young girls. - In the last three days, 256 women and girls, including 42 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, have received psychological and other support, while 66 newly-identified unaccompanied children were also receiving help. - Seven schools have been opened to new arrivals to take shelter in the refugee camps. - Sanitation and access to safe water is a concern especially at the no man\u2019s land with no facilities. - Humanitarian agencies had already been building, prior to the fresh influx of refugees, 450 emergency latrines, 50 accessible latrines, 200 bathing cubicles for women and adolescent girls, repairing 200 existing latrines, distributing 800 hand-washing devices and 650 hygiene promotion sessions in two border regions.

France, which took a leading role in the NATO air campaign that helped rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi, has sought to play a greater role in Libya, believing diplomatic efforts were stalling and that under President Emmanuel Macron it could fill that void. Officials fear jihadist groups could try to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq, and see a resolution to the conflict as vital to ending Europe\u2019s migrant crisis. \u201cIn Libya, France along with others has a specific responsibility to help this country find unity and stability,\u201d Le Drian said. Past attempts at peace deals in oil-producing Libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the myriad of competing armed groups that have emerged since rebels toppled  Gaddafi in 2011.  Diplomats declined to say specifically when Le Drian was traveling due to security reasons.   The French initiative has angered officials in Italy, which has previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former North African colony and borne the brunt of successive waves of African migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya.

Following are some details on the emerging crisis gathered from United Nations\u2019 sources working in the Cox\u2019s Bazar district of Bangladesh: - Aid workers operating in the area say resources including materials for emergency shelters, safe water and food are urgently needed and extreme overcrowding in the existing makeshift settlements remains a major problem. The fluid movement of refugees also makes it difficult to identify new arrivals. - With another 10,000 people currently trapped in no-man\u2019s land between the two countries, they expect more people to cross the border than during the crisis in the fall of last year, when more than 70,000 people made the journey.  - The stock of high-energy biscuits is not sufficient to feed all the new arrivals, and funding for rice to cover people who have crossed since October \u201cmay be problematic\u201d. - Among new arrivals, about 16,000 are school-age children and more than 5,000 are under the age of five who need vaccine coverage. The number of unaccompanied and separated children is high and many are found \u201ctraumatized and hungry\u201d and in need of immediate dry food and psycho-social support.  - Current capacity of emergency education facilities is only enough to cover 5,000 children and an additional 500 schools or learning centres are needed.  - To prevent abuses, they say awareness on subjects including child labour, sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking is needed among the communities.  - Worsened hygiene due to mass influx increases the risk of outbreak of diseases, with pregnant women, young children or  the elderly being most vulnerable.  - Sanitation and access to safe water is a concern especially at the no man\u2019s land with no facilities.

The United States has ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in San Francisco and two buildings housing trade missions in Washington and New York. It is the latest broadside in a tit-for-tat exchange between the countries that has helped push relations towards a new post-Cold War low. Russian diplomats were working to vacate the properties over the weekend, including the six-story consulate. \u201cWe treat these developments as a blatantly hostile act, a grave violation by Washington of international law,\u201d the Russian foreign ministry said of the U.S. order, which was made in late August in retaliation for Moscow cutting the United States\u2019 diplomatic presence in Russia. \u201cWe urge the U.S. authorities to come to their senses and immediately return the Russian diplomatic facilities,\u201d the ministry added on its website. \u201cOtherwise the USA will bear total blame for the ongoing degradation of the relations between our countries.\u201d  Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said that U.S. authorities had told Moscow that they expected Russia to sell the facilities, TASS state news agency reported. Relations between the two nations have been badly strained since Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, developments which led Washington to impose sanctions on Russia.  U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, saying he wanted to improve ties. But relations have been damaged by accusations from American intelligence officials that Russia sought to meddle in the presidential election, something Moscow denies. Trump, himself battling allegations his associates colluded with Russia, grudgingly signed into law last month new sanctions against Moscow that had been drawn up by Congress. When it became clear those measures would become law, Moscow ordered the United States to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in Russia by more than half, to 455 people.

Nearly 400 people have been killed in northwest Myanmar over the past week in insurgent attacks on security posts and an army crackdown. Aid agencies estimate that 73,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh from Myanmar since violence erupted. \u201cYou watched the situation that Myanmar and Muslims are in,\u201d Erdogan said in Istanbul, where he was attending the funeral of a Turkish soldier. \u201cYou saw how villages have been burnt... Humanity remained silent to the massacre in Myanmar\u201d. He said Turkey would raise the issue at the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month. As current head of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, Erdogan had discussed the violence with around 20 world leaders. \u201cThere are some leaders we can achieve results with and some that we cannot. Not everyone has the same sensitivity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do our duty,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that Turkey was continuing to deliver aid to the region. Myanmar has urged Muslims in the northwest to cooperate in the search for insurgents, whose coordinated attacks on security posts and an army crackdown have led to one of the deadliest bouts of violence to engulf the Rohingya community in decades. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar\u2019s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for a religious minority that has long complained of persecution. Erdogan said on Friday that the death of hundreds of Rohingya in Myanmar over the past week constituted a genocide aimed at Muslim communities in the region. Hundreds more refugees on Sunday walked through rice paddies from the Naf river separating the two countries into Bangladesh, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities already helping tens of thousands.

Morabito entered Uruguay in 2001, and took up residence with his wife in the coastal resort city of Punta del Este, the Uruguayan interior ministry said in a statement.

Morabito was jailed in Uruguay for using false documents while Italy\u2019s request for extradition is processed, the statement said, adding that $50,000 in cash was found at his home along with 13 cell phones.     An international arrest warrant was issued in 1995 with the aim of tracking down Morabito and extraditing him to Italy, where he has been sentenced to 30 years in jail.

The trigger for the sharpening of the travel advice was the detention at the coastal Antalya airport last week of two Germans, one of whom has since been released. Berlin believes they, like 11 others, were detained for political reasons. \u201cThere is a risk of similar detentions in all parts of Turkey, including in tourist regions,\u201d the new advice reads. It falls short of a formal travel warning, issued for war-afflicted countries like Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen, which would make obtaining travel insurance harder. \u201cWe can\u2019t take from tourists the decision whether to travel or not,\u201d Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. \u201cBut we have described in detail what you should be aware of before you go.\u201d Large numbers of European citizens have been caught up in the crackdown following last year\u2019s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan, in the wake of which tens of thousands of Turks have been imprisoned on \u201cterrorism\u201d charges.

While it was not immediately clear what the motivation for the shooting was, the kingdom has been subject to several coups and periodic political violence since gaining independence from Britain in 1966, and South Africa called for calm. Colonel Tanki Mothae, the principal secretary for the defense force, told Reuters the two senior officers were under investigation for the murder of another former Lesotho defense commander in 2015. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, who fled the country in 2014 after a coup attempt and whose wife was shot dead in June, offered no details about the killings during a news conference other than saying the incident was being investigated.

Ukraine believes external peacekeepers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be deployed throughout separatist-held territory and on the sections of the Ukraine-Russia border that are not under Kiev\u2019s control. Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies. Putin also said on Tuesday that any decision by the United States to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine would fuel the conflict.

Vyshkovsky said that the finance ministry hoped to agree on new conditions for how Caracas would honor the debt by the end of 2017.  \u201cWhat the conditions would be like and how quickly we would find a compromise remains to be seen. But our partners speak about a strong desire to reach an agreement quickly,\u201d Vyshkovsky said. Vyshkovsky declined to say when he would expect Caracas to pay back its debt.

Zhou Hongxu, formerly a student in Taiwan, was charged for seeking to arrange meetings between a Taiwan government official and a Chinese Communist party official outside Taiwan, in return for payment to the Taiwan official, a court document showed. Zhou \u201cintentionally\u201d jeopardized national security, though the attempt was unsuccessful, the court said in the document released after the verdict.    Zhou, who had met the Chinese official at a 2014 event in  Shanghai in 2014, did not plead guilty, his lawyer said, despite a confession during the trial that he later described as having  been made in improper circumstances.  He appeared in court on Friday in a calm mood and dressed in dark colors.  The court reduced his sentence, taking into account his confession, and the failure of the bid to breach national security, it said in its statement. On Monday, a Taiwanese activist, Li Ming-che, confessed in a Chinese court to attempting to subvert the Beijing government,  videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities showed, although his wife refused to recognize the court\u2019s authority. Li, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, had gone\u00a0missing on a trip to mainland China in March.

Germany has criticized mass arrests carried out in Turkey since last year\u2019s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking re-election on Sunday, has called for Turkey\u2019s EU accession talks to be called off. Germany also says it is limiting arms sales to Turkey.  Turkey says Germany has ignored Ankara\u2019s requests for the extradition of suspects it believes are linked to the putsch and accused Berlin of using Nazi-like tactics by banning pro-Erdogan rallies on German soil.

The military response to insurgent attacks in the western region of Myanmar last month sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, escaping what the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. Myanmar\u2019s government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting. Britain, France and Australia urged Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday to push for an end to military violence against Rohingya Muslims. Her national security adviser said those who had fled could return but the process had to be discussed. Wang told Guterres at a meeting at the United Nations on Monday China \u201cunderstands and supports\u201d Myanmar\u2019s efforts to protect its security in Rakhine and hopes the \u201cfire of war\u201d can soon be extinguished, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

China and Myanmar have close economic and diplomatic ties and China has defied expectations that democratization in the former Burma could lead to weaker relations between the two countries. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev is barred by the constitution from running for a second term. His Social Democratic party, which leads a majority coalition in parliament, is backing Sooronbai Jeenbekov, who stepped down as prime minister last month in order to run for the presidency.

It said Nazarbayev had not expressed support for any particular candidate and had held a similar meeting with Jeenbekov in August. Kyrgyzstan, a mostly Muslim ex-Soviet nation, is a parliamentary republic where two previous presidents have been toppled by protests. Kyrgyzstan hosts a Russian military air base and its economy relies heavily on remittances from migrant laborers working in Russia, as well as on gold mining. Kazakhstan, a bigger and wealthier Central Asian nation, is also a Russian ally, but relations between Bishkek and Astana have been rocky due to tensions over cross-border trade and the sharing of water resources.

The U.N. peacekeeper eventually escaped eight months after his abduction, the court said. It said there was not enough evidence to conclude that Nusra Front was behind the kidnapping nor that the Syrian man was a member of the militant group. \u201cThe accused was found guilty under the Code on International Criminal Law of being an accessory to a war crime against a peacekeeping mission that involved kidnapping for ransom, three counts of attempted robbery by blackmail and grievous unlawful detention,\u201d the court wrote in a statement.

The vote, expected to deliver a comfortable \u201cyes\u201d for independence, is not binding and is meant to give Massoud Barzani\u2019s KRG a mandate to negotiate secession of the oil producing region with Baghdad and neighboring states.[nL8N1M60E9] The referendum is being held despite intense international pressure on Barzani to call it off, amid fears that it would spark fresh conflicts with Baghdad and with Iraq\u2019s powerful neighbors, Iran and Turkey. \u201cThe Chinese government supports Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing, when asked about the referendum. \u201cWe hope the relevant sides can resolve the differences via dialogue, and find an inclusive solution that takes into account history and reality, to jointly protect Iraqi and regional stability,\u201d Lu added. This will help promote Iraq\u2019s rebuilding and counter-terrorism efforts and accords with the joint interests of countries in the region and the international community, he said. China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, is generally a low-key player in the Middle East despite its reliance on the region for oil, but has been trying to get more involved, for example by appointing a special envoy for the Syrian crisis. China says it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other countries internal affairs, but it generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world. At home, it contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and has repeatedly expressed concern that self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, could declare formal independence.

The British national, known as QT, had been refused a dependant\u2019s visa on the grounds that she was not a \u201cspouse\u201d, even though she had entered a civil partnership in England. Marriage in Hong Kong is defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman, but discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule with wide-ranging autonomy, including a free judiciary, in 1997.    In a unanimous decision reached by three judges, the Court of Appeal found that the director of immigration failed to justify the \u201cindirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation that QT suffers\u201d. While the legal definition of marriage was not challenged in the appeal, chief judge Andrew Cheung wrote that \u201ctimes have changed and an increasing number of people are no longer prepared to accept the status quo without critical thought\u201d. \u201cExcluding a foreign worker\u2019s lawfully married (albeit same-sex) spouse or civil partner ... to join the worker is, quite obviously, counter-productive to attracting the worker to come to or remain in Hong Kong to work in the first place,\u201d he added. The court ordered QT and the Department of Immigration to work together on an agreement and submit it to court within 28 days.  Hong Kong\u2019s LGBT advocates welcomed the decision, with the city\u2019s first openly gay lawmaker, Ray Chan, calling it a \u201cbig win for same-sex dependants to apply for a visa to stay in Hong Kong\u201d. Same-sex marriage was legalized in Taiwan in May, a first in Asia. In mainland China, homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder until 2001, but it is not illegal to be gay.

Washington this year has issued several rounds of sanctions against Venezuelan officials, partly in response to the creation of a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly that critics call the consolidation of a dictatorship. President Nicolas Maduro has called those sanctions a financial blockade against the country, which is grappling with triple-digit inflation and chronic product shortages as its economy unravels. The text of the U.S. travel restrictions released on Sunday mentions officials at agencies including the Interior Ministry, the investigative police known as CICPC, the Saime passport and identification office, as well as the Foreign Ministry.

Putin is expected to meet his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday for talks on Syria. Major-General Igor Konashenkov of the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Russian and Syrian air forces did not bomb residential areas and accused the observatory of making up allegations and of sympathizing with radical Islamist militants. \u201cIn the last few days, after drone reconnaissance and confirmation via other channels, Russian planes struck 10 terrorist targets in Idlib Province,\u201d Konashenkov said.  \u201cThese were militant bases, ammunition stores, armored vehicles, rocket systems, and workshops fitting out \u2018jihad jeeps\u2019 which were located a long way from residential areas,\u201d he said. Konashenkov said Russia had data to confirm the accuracy of its attacks and the ministry on Tuesday published video of the strikes on Idlib to back its assertions that it had only bombed militant targets. The targets struck had taken part in a militant offensive on Sept. 18 which had surrounded 29 Russian military policemen who then had to be broken out in an operation backed by air power, he added.

In March 2015, infantry conscript Elor Azaria was caught on videotape shooting dead a Palestinian who was lying wounded after taking part in a stabbing attack on other Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron. Azaria said he shot Abd Elfatah Ashareef because he feared the Palestinian could carry out another attack, but a court-martial found contradictions in the testimony and convicted him of manslaughter. The verdict was upheld on appeal. After being discharged from the military, Azaria went to prison last month and appealed to the armed forces chief, Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot, to reconsider his sentence, citing the cost to his family of the acrimonious trial. In a response letter made public on Wednesday, the military informed Azaria that Eizenkot had decided to cut the jail term \u201con grounds of compassion and mercy ... taking into account your past as a combat soldier in an operational theater\u201d. But the letter also faulted the former soldier over \u201cgrave actions for which you did not take responsibility and for which you did not express regret,\u201d adding that \u201cthe important messages in the court rulings should be heeded\u201d. Azaria became a right-wing cause celebre in Israel, where most Jewish men and women are drafted at 18 for military service. One poll found that nearly half of Israeli Jews believe any Palestinian attacker should be killed on the spot. The Palestinian government said Azaria\u2019s jail term had given Israeli soldiers a \u201cgreen light\u201d to kill with impunity. Under Israeli law, manslaughter can carry a maximum 20 years behind bars. Military prosecutors had asked the appeals court to impose a three- to five-year sentence on Azaria, but were turned down.

Security analysts expressed surprise when Chad, a key U.S. security partner since the Cold War, was named last week alongside North Korea and Venezuela as part of an eight-country the travel ban. Chad\u2019s army acts as a bulwark against local and regional armed movements and played a critical role in pushing back troops from jihadist group Boko Haram when they made a bid to expand beyond northeastern Nigeria in 2015. Its troops continue to hold front-line positions in unstable north Mali where jihadists ousted government authorities five years ago. As recently as February, Chad, also a key French ally, hosted a U.S. military training exercise for special forces as part of a broader strategy to empower regional troops such as the G5 Sahel security bloc consisting of Chad, Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso.   \u201cThe president of the G5 thinks this decision could affect the commitment of Chad, which has until now shown itself to be a key partner in the fight against terrorism in the G5 Sahel and beyond,\u201d said Keita in a statement sent to journalists late on Wednesday. \u201cThe president...calls on the authorities to favorably re-examine the matter by lifting the sanctions against Chad,\u201d he added. Chadian officials expressed surprised at the decision earlier this week, calling it \u201cincomprehensible\u201d.  The new U.S. measures, which have no end-date, help fulfill a campaign promise President Donald Trump made to tighten U.S. immigration procedures and align with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy vision. The White House says the restrictions are the consequences for countries not meeting new requirements for vetting immigrants and issuing visas.
