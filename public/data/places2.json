U.S. and NATO coalition troops are deployed in Helmand to train and advise Afghan security forces struggling against Taliban insurgents.

Several thousand additional American forces operate as part of a separate counterterrorism mission in the country.

A former Soviet republic of 31 million, run by strongman president Islam Karimov from 1989 until his death last September, Uzbekistan has had a rocky relationship with Moscow, and by extension the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). It suspended its membership in the bloc between 1999 and 2006 and then quit it altogether in 2012. Following Karimov\u2019s death from a stroke and pledges by his successor, former prime minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to develop a strategic partnership with Russia, some have wondered whether Tashkent would rejoin the military alliance. But, answering a question about it in a televised interview on Wednesday, Kamilov said, \u201cThe question of renewing our CSTO membership is not on the agenda ... There are no plans to discuss or review this matter in the future.\u201d Russia has used the CSTO, along with the Eurasian Economic Union, another regional bloc focused on trade, to project influence across most of the former Soviet Union. It regards Central Asia as an area of strategic interest. But only three out of the region\u2019s five nations - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, whose combined populations are smaller than that of Uzbekistan - are CSTO members. "},

Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker, a longtime diplomat, will be responsible for advancing U.S. interests as set out in the 2015 Minsk agreement to curb the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region. He will accompany Tillerson to Kiev on Sunday, the State Department said. Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014, and Kiev accuses it of backing pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, an allegation the Kremlin denies. The Minsk agreement called for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. \u201cAt the request of President (Vladimir) Putin, the United States has appointed ... a special representative for Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker,\u201d Tillerson told reporters after a meeting between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko welcomed the choice, writing in a message on Twitter that it would help end what he called Russian aggression and restore Crimea to Ukraine. \u201cImportant & timely move in the interests of ending Russian aggression and restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, including Crimea,\u201d Poroshenko tweeted. Volker was a career diplomat who served as permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama. He is currently a foreign policy and national security expert at the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University. \u201cKurt\u2019s wealth of experience makes him uniquely qualified to move this conflict in the direction of peace,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement. \u201cThe United States remains fully committed to the objectives of the Minsk agreements, and I have complete confidence in Kurt to continue our efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine.\u201d Julie Smith, a former Pentagon official who worked on European and NATO policy during the Obama administration, praised the choice of Volker as Ukraine envoy, but said she was puzzled at Tillerson\u2019s statement that he filled the position at Putin\u2019s request. \u201cSo Ukraine didn\u2019t matter enough to this administration to have them appoint a special envoy in the first place?\u201d said Smith, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt was a bizarre word choice.\u201d "},

The cabinet approved the purchase of eight further jets in the second phase of a 2015 deal in which Thailand bought four jets from South Korea, Prayuth told reporters in Bangkok.  \u201cWe got the South Korean ones,\u201d Prayuth added. \u201cYou can see that we are not tied to one particular country.\u201d On Monday, the army said the deal was worth 8.8 billion baht ($258 million). Last month, Thailand\u2019s army chief said the United States planned to sell four Black Hawk helicopters to Thailand after initially suspending their sale following the 2014 coup. The United States has sold Thailand military equipment worth more than $960 million, including Black Hawk helicopters, air-to-air missile systems and multiple naval missile and torpedo systems, over the past decade. Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said the jets would replace 20-year-old planes that were due to be decommissioned. "},

Egypt has said its police carried out checks on Regeni\u2019s activities following concerns raised by the union chief, but found nothing of interest.

The country\u2019s election commission president said on Sunday that the vote, originally due in November 2016, was unlikely to take place in 2017, because of delays in registering millions of voters. Further delays could trigger additional unrest following anti-government street protests last year in which security forces killed dozens of demonstrators. The opposition quickly denounced Sunday\u2019s announcement as a declaration of \u201cwar\u201d. \u201cWe are ready to take additional action to sanction those who stand in the way of DRC\u2019s first democratic transition of power,\u201d U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Michele Sison told the U.N. Security Council.  The United States imposed sanctions on several Congolese officials last year - blocking any financial assets in the United States and generally barring Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them - for hindering democracy. \u201cThe Security Council should also consider targeted sanctions to reduce the violence in the DRC and help pressure all stakeholders to play a more constructive role in moving the country forward,\u201d Sison said.  Kabila has refused to step down at the end of his second elected term in December, sparking protests that killed dozens of people. Militia violence has also intensified across Congo, raising fears the country will slide back into the wars at the turn of the century that killed millions. The IMF has told Congo that \u201ca credible path toward political stability\u201d will probably be a condition of any assistance package, a letter seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday. Under an accord struck on Dec. 31 between Kabila\u2019s representatives and opposition leaders, Kabila, in power since 2001, is barred from trying to change the constitution to stand for a third term. About 80,000 people have fled fighting between the Congolese army and a new rebel coalition, the United Nations said on Tuesday. Conflict has forced more than 1.5 million Congolese to flee their homes this year, while more than 3,000 have died since last October in central Congo\u2019s Kasai region. "},

Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathy welcomed the lifting of the ban and said it came as a result of close cooperation between Cairo International Airport and EgyptAir employees, which put U.S. authorities at ease.

A spokesman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to telephone calls and emails to seek comment. Two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a revised version of Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, though it excluded visitors with a \u201cbona fide\u201d family tie. The executive order itself did not apply to travelers with valid visas. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had called for a \u201ccomplete and total shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States, a move he called necessary to protect national security in the wake of attacks at home and abroad by Islamist extremists. Opponents of the idea called it a violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protections for free expression of religion. Trump\u2019s initial January version of the order, which also applied to Iraq, caused a weekend of chaos at U.S. airports as travelers were turned away upon arrival and crowds of thousands turned out to protest against the move.

The agreement, signed late Wednesday, will create a documentation center for the community, as well as a memorial for victims that were tortured and killed within its confines. Colonia Dignidad was founded in 1961 by former World War II German army medic Paul Schaefer. The community, which embraced ultra-traditional values, operated as an isolated cult under Schaefer, who sexually abused and tortured dozens of youths. During the 1973 to 1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the community also served as a detention and torture site for enemies of the regime.  As Latin America has transitioned to democracy in recent decades, truth commissions and public displays documenting past abuses have become common in many countries, including Chile. In 2006, former members of the cult issued a public apology and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of human rights abuses in their community, saying they were brainwashed by Schaefer, who many viewed as a God.

Turkey has also sent 200 cargo planes with supplies to Qatar since its Gulf neighbors cut air and sea links. Qatar\u2019s only land border is with Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson left Qatar on Thursday after a tour of Gulf Arab countries aimed at easing the worst regional dispute in years, saying he had made proposals that would help resolve the crisis.

He has denied any wrongdoing. Wearing handcuffs and a bulletproof vest, Duarte was transferred on Monday morning from the military prison where he had been held since his arrest to Guatemalan Air Force facilities, where he set off for Mexico.  The 43-year-old landed in Mexico City airport a few hours later. Official video footage showed him disembarking from a government plane, and being led away by armed guards.  Duarte\u2019s case has become emblematic of government failure to root out corruption, undermining support for the PRI, which has been Mexico\u2019s dominant party for most of the past century. Elected governor in 2010, he is alleged to have acquired luxury properties in Mexico and abroad, defrauding taxpayers of sums some estimates put in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and using shell companies to transfer and hide public funds.  Duarte was arrested in Guatemala in April after more than five months on the run. Corruption is shaping up to be one of the focal points of next year\u2019s presidential election, with opinion polls showing the PRI is seriously at risk of being voted out of office. "},

Forty Israelis, two U.S. tourists and a British student have been killed in Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car-rammings. A few of the attacks had been carried out by Arab Israeli citizens. Israel blames the violence on incitement by the Palestinian leadership.

The offer stemmed from talks in Manila earlier this week between Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and his Philippines counterpart Delfin Lorenzana. Surrounded by Muslim majority countries and with a Muslim minority of its own, Singapore is worried by the small but dangerous number of people in the region who have been radicalised by Islamic State.  Ministers describe the terror threat against the wealthy city-state as the highest in recent years and alarm was heightened in May when a militant group linked to Islamic State seized Marawi City on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao. Security forces are still battling to regain control of the town and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week asked Congress to extend martial law until the end of the year on Mindanao, the only Muslim majority island in the largely Catholic Philippines. During the past two months Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines launched joint maritime and air patrols over their  shared boundaries in the Sulu Sea, to guard against the movement of militants between Borneo Island and Mindanao. Supporting the regional effort, Singapore\u2019s Defence Ministry said that it had offered a C-130 transport plane to deliver humanitarian supplies, drone surveillance aircraft, and use of training facilities for the Philippines military. \u201cWhile the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) is confident that Marawi will be secured from terrorists soon, further concerted efforts are required to ensure that other terrorist cells do not entrench themselves in the southern Philippines, as this would cause instability to the rest of ASEAN,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.  Fearful that Islamic State could build a base in Southeast Asia, governments in the region announced last month that they plan share intelligence, using spy planes and drones to stem the movement of militants across their porous borders.

Russia says the Polish move spits in the faces of the more than 600,000 Soviet troops who lost their lives liberating Poland from the Nazis.

Poland was under Soviet control for over four decades after the Second World War and the last Russian soldiers only left in 1993.

The two leaders had a high-profile summit in Florida in April and Trump has frequently praised Xi while resisting criticism of Chinese trade practices. North Korea recently said it conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, and that it had mastered the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on the missile. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty. The past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism as well as rhetoric that has  stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions rose sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. "},

U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced concern over what he sees as growing Iranian influence in conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where it is aligned with Shi\u2019ite fighters. Tensions between Iran and the United States have heightened since the election of Trump, who has often accused Tehran of backing militant groups and destabilizing the region.

Rosenthal, 52, further admitted that the meatpacking company exported beef from those cattle to the United States. Rosenthal was charged in October 2015 along with his father, Jaime Rosenthal, a former vice president of Honduras, his cousin, Yankel Rosenthal, a former minister of investment under current Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez; and Andres Acosta Garcia, a lawyer for Grupo Continental. Prosecutors have said that the four men engaged in a multi-year scheme to launder proceeds of narcotics trafficking and bribery offenses through accounts located in the United States. The other three defendants have not pleaded guilty or been convicted. Jaime Rosenthal remains in Honduras, though U.S. authorities are seeking to have him extradited. As part of his plea, Yani Rosenthal also agreed to forfeit $500,000 and pay a fine of $2.5 million. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 13 by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl. The money laundering charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, though prosecutors and Rosenthal agreed as part of the plea that federal guidelines call for a sentence of between four years three months, and five years three months. In addition to serving in the cabinet of former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya in 2006 and 2007, Rosenthal was a member of the nation\u2019s legislature between 2010 and 2014, and ran for president in 2009 and 2013.

Milley, in remarks to the National Press Club in Washington, said there was still time for a non-military solution to the crisis caused by North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, but cautioned that \u201ctime is running out.\u201d  \u201cNorth Korea is extremely dangerous and more dangerous as the weeks go by,\u201d he said. U.S. media reported this week that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon spy agency, had assessed that North Korea would be able to field a nuclear-capable ICBM by next year, earlier than previously thought. However, two U.S. officials said some other analysts who study North Korea\u2019s missile program did not agree with the  assessment, although there was no question that Pyongyang had moved further and faster in its efforts. U.S. officials said on Tuesday they had seen increased North Korean activity that could be preparations for another missile test within days. After its July 4 test, North Korea said it had mastered the technology needed to deploy a nuclear warhead via the missile. It also said the test verified the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead, which experts say may be able to reach the U.S. state of Alaska. North Korea has made no secret of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States and has ignored international calls to halt its weapons programs. The vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Paul Selva, said last week that North Korea did not have the ability to strike the United States with \u201cany degree of accuracy\u201d and that while its missiles had the range, they lacked the necessary guidance capability.

The migrants, 74 from Honduras,\u00a059 from Guatemala, 13 from El Salvador and one from Nicaragua were in the back of the poorly ventilated vehicle as they traveled to the border state of Tamaulipas, where they would eventually be smuggled into the United States, Mexico\u2019s national immigration institute said. Among those rescued were 48 minors, including 14 traveling without an adult companion. They were abandoned near a highway in the city of Ozuluama, Veracruz. Earlier this month, 10 people died and 29 were hospitalized after more than 100 illegal immigrants were packed into a stifling tractor trailer for a 150-mile (240-km) drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to San Antonio, where survivors spilled out into a Walmart parking lot in the Texas city. \u201cAccording to the testimony of migrants, the alleged traffickers, who used the Veracruz-Tampico route, in order to reach the United States, abandoned the migrants in the wilderness, where they were forced to hide in the bushes\u201d without food or water, the immigration institute said. Personnel from the immigration institute gave medical attention, food and water to the rescued Central Americans and contacted their respective embassies. Plagued by gang violence and poverty, the trio of Central American nations, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, together send the bulk of migrants entering the United States illegally. Turf wars between gangs have sparked a surge in violence in Mexico in the past 18 months, also raising the incentive for some young Mexicans to risk the crossing. "},
