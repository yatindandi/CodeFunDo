The apparent failure of the re-entry vehicle in Friday\u2019s  test could mean North Korea will need to carry out several more tests of its intercontinental ballistic missile before it can be deemed operational, missile expert Michael Elleman told reporters. Elleman, an expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, cited video taken by a weather camera in Japan\u2019s Hokkaido Prefecture broadcast by Japan\u2019s NHK television.In a report for 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, Elleman said the video showed the reentry vehicle shedding small radiant objects at an altitude of 4 or 5 km (2.5 to 3 miles) before dimming and disappearing.  \u201cHad the RV survived the rigors of re-entry, it would have continued to glow ... A reasonable conclusion based on the video evidence is that the ... re-entry vehicle did not survive,\u201d he said. Even so, Elleman said, further testing could still allow North Korea to deploy an operational ICBM next year. U.S. officials say the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon spy agency, has determined that North Korea will be able to field a reliable nuclear-capable ICBM by next year, earlier than previously thought.North Korea said on Saturday its second ICBM test, which followed its first on July 4, had proven its ability to strike the whole of the U.S. mainland. Some U.S.-based experts said last week\u2019s launch showed the missile could have been capable of going as far into the United States as Denver and Chicago, with New York and Washington just out of range. However, John Schilling, another missile expert and 38 North contributor, said last week the improved performance over the July 4 test could have been the result of using a lighter payload to improve its range. Elleman said the size of the payload was crucial to range and a lighter payload could mean a more fragile re-entry vehicle less able to withstand reentry. He estimated the current missile was probably capable of carrying a 500 kg bomb (1,100 pound) of similar power to those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War Two as far as the U.S. West Coast.

U.S. oil sales to PDVSA are mostly heavy naphtha and light crude that the company uses to dilute and make exportable the extra heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt. The South American country this year has imported an average of 87,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. refined products and about 19,000 bpd of light crude through a leased storage facility in the neighboring island of Curacao, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If sanctions also restrict the flow of U.S. finished fuels and components to PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s domestic market could face deeper supply problems. The country already has suffered intermittent gasoline shortages this year, and a U.S. cutoff would require the state-run firm to find providers in more distant markets such as Rotterdam.

Building a pipeline linking Russia and Japan is a long-standing idea, but a dispute over islands seized by Russia near the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of the World War Two has kept relations testy at times. Japanese gas and electric utilities that have invested heavily in import terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) may also be reluctant to invest in a pipeline. \u201cWithout a sense of further sense of trust such as a peace treaty, a pipeline would be no good,\u201d Seko said during a speech in Tokyo while answering a question about Japan\u2019s energy relationship with Russia. Japan imports nearly all of its energy sources and is the world\u2019s biggest buyer of LNG, which is natural gas cooled until it becomes a liquid and then transported on ships. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in April that Japan  wants to resolve a territorial row that has over-shadowed ties with Russia since World War Two. Russia and Japan did not sign a formal peace treaty at the end of the war because of a dispute over the northern islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kuriles in Russia. The islands were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war and 17,000 Japanese residents were forced to flee.     Despite the lingering dispute, Seko said that Japan imports around 10 percent of its LNG from\u00a0Russia and the country could increase its reliance on Russia\u2019s LNG a little bit more.

The dead included a family of 14 who had fled to Raqqa from the desert city of Palmyra, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment. The coalition has previously said it strenuously tries to avoid civilian casualties and investigates all reports that its strikes have killed civilians.  The coalition said in July that its strikes had killed at least 600 civilians in both Iraq and Syria since it began operations in 2014, a figure that is far lower than those given by independent monitors.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of coalition-backed groups, began its assault on Raqqa in June after a months-long campaign to isolate the city.  The U.S.-led coalition has helped it with airstrikes and some artillery support from special forces, as well as by arming the Kurdish-led SDF.  Islamic State has retreated over the past 18 months from much of its Syrian territory under attack from three rival forces: the SDF, the Syrian army, and Turkey-backed rebels.

North Korea has made no secret of plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile able to strike the United States and has ignored international calls to halt its nuclear and missile programs. The strike plan would be put into practice at any moment once leader Kim Jong Un makes a decision, a spokesman for the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) said in a statement carried by the North\u2019s state-run KCNA news agency. \u201cThe KPA Strategic Force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the U.S. major military bases on Guam including the Anderson Air Force Base,\u201d the spokesman said. The plan would be reported to the North\u2019s Supreme Command soon, the spokesman said, without citing a date. On Monday, two US B-1 bombers flew from Guam over the Korean Peninsula as a part of its \u201ccontinuous bomber presence,\u201d a U.S. official said, in a sign of the strategic importance Guam holds. In another statement citing a different military spokesman, North Korea also accused the United States of devising a \u201cpreventive war\u201d and said any plans to execute this would be met with an \u201call-out war wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the U.S. mainland.\u201d The United States should stop its \u201creckless military provocation\u201d against North Korea to avoid any military action, the army spokesman said. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Saturday over its continued missile tests.

A military media unit run by Hezbollah, a close ally of the Syrian government, said the army and its allies had gained control over all checkpoints and border posts on the border in Sweida, one of four Syrian provinces that border Jordan.  Rebel groups, some of them backed by Western and Arab states, still control much of Syria\u2019s southwestern frontier with Jordan and Israel.  Sweida province was not included in a U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire that took effect in nearby areas of the southwest in July. Said Saef, spokesman for the Western-backed rebel group Martyr Ahmed Abdo brigade, said Thursday\u2019s attack came from two sides in Sweida\u2019s east countryside. \u201cMost of the eastern Sweida countryside is now in the hands of the regime,\u201d he added. The army had advanced to the border and retaken posts it abandoned in the early years of the conflict when rebels took over large parts of south western Syria. \u201cThey are now on the Jordanian border and back to outposts they had evacuated early in the conflict,\u201d said Saef. Another rebel spokesman said the army gains were helped by a sudden pull-back by Jaish al-Ashair rebel group, which is backed by Jordan and had been responsible for patrolling that stretch of the border. The Syrian military source said the army and its allies had taken more than 30 km of the border, and described the advance as a \u201cbig success\u201d.

The step by prosecutors in the northern town of Winterthur comes amid heightened sensitivity to the risk of Islamist violence in Switzerland, whose spy agency warned about the threat in May. Prosecutors did not name the imam, one of four people they said were linked to the local An\u2019Nur mosque and who have been under investigation since November on suspicion of inciting criminal or violent acts. \u201cIn his homily of Oct. 21, 2016, in the An\u2019Nur Mosque, he is accused among other things of calling for expelling Muslims who do not pray in the community, and even burning them and killing them in their homes if they still refuse,\u201d the prosecutors said in a statement. He was also accused of sharing brutal depictions of killings via Facebook and of working as an imam without authorization. Prosecutors are seeking an 18-month suspended sentence and expulsion from Switzerland for 15 years for the cleric, who has been held in investigative custody since November. Efforts to reach the mosque were not immediately successful. A number listed for the An\u2019Nur cultural association that runs the mosque was no longer in service. Swiss federal authorities say they have identified more than 500 internet users with Swiss connections who were using social media to spread jihadist ideas. Concerns about militancy and potential attacks led Swiss voters to back a law last year extending the national spy service\u2019s authority to monitor internet traffic, deploy drones and hack foreign computer systems. Switzerland has so far not been targeted directly in an Islamist attack, but it has had several links to attacks  elsewhere in Europe last year.

On Monday the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said that an Iranian drone had come within 1,000 feet (300 meters) of a U.S. aircraft carrier while it was in international waters in the Gulf conducting flight operations. Spokesman Lieutenant Ian McConnaughey said the Iranian drone \u201cconducted an unsafe and unprofessional approach\u201d as it passed by the USS Nimitz without navigation lights late on Sunday. Iran\u2019s IRGC said in a statement published on Tasnim news agency late on Monday that \u201cit carries out air patrol missions in Iran\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) every day and in accordance with current regulations\u201d. \u201cThe Revolutionary Guards drones are equipped with standard navigation systems and are controlled professionally,\u201d it added. The IRGC accused the United States of not having \u201ccapable identification and reconnaissance systems\u201d.  U.S. officials have complained of numerous unsafe and unprofessional interactions between the United States and Iranian maritime forces this year. Last Tuesday, a U.S. official said an Iranian drone had approached a U.S. fighter jet as it prepared to land on the aircraft carrier. The official said at the time that it was the 13th such incident in 2017. The administration of President Donald Trump has recently struck a hard line on Iran, saying Tehran was violating the spirit of an accord struck by the Obama administration that lifted sanctions and sought to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations.

Islamic State said the perpetrators of the latest one had been responding to its call to target countries involved in a U.S.-led coalition against the Sunni militant group. The driver of the van may still be alive and at large, Spanish police said on Friday, denying earlier reports he had been killed. Five would-be attackers were shot dead by police in a seaside town.

The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided while the guided-missile vessel was nearing Singapore on Monday. The collision tore a hole in the warship\u2019s port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. Ten sailors are missing. The collision - the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year - prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations to focus on safety. The state-run China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that people will wonder why such a sophisticated navy keeps having these problems. \u201cThe investigations into the latest collision will take time to reach their conclusions, but there is no denying the fact that the increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific since Washington initiated its rebalancing to the region are making them a growing risk to commercial shipping,\u201d it said.

The withdrawal coincided with reports that Skopje was joining diplomatic efforts to secure Kosovo\u2019s membership in the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.

Trump said he would ask coalition allies to support his new strategy, with additional troops and funding, to end the 16-year conflict.

The arrival in Germany of a million refugees over the last two years, mainly from Syria and Iraq, opened deep rifts in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party and is becoming a campaign theme ahead of a Sept. 24 national election. Merkel and the European Union have already sealed a migrants deal with Turkey to stem the flow from the Middle East and her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the Egypt deal would \u201cfight illegal immigration and the criminal smuggling of people\u201d. \u201cUnder this agreement, there are a number of measures for political and economic support so that a better climate and better living conditions can be achieved for refugees in Egypt,\u201d Seibert told a regular government news conference in Berlin. \u201cTogether, we will set up a center for jobs, migration and reintegration\u201d, he added. This center would be in Egypt, a transit country for migrants striving to reach Europe. In Paris, meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron prepared to host a summit of Europe\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d continental powers including Germany, as well as three African nations to tackle Europe\u2019s migrant crisis. Libya, Chad and Niger are all transit nations for migrants bound for Europe.  Since Turkey and the EU reached an agreement a year ago to curb the flow of migrants and refugees sailing from Turkish shores to Greece, most migrants have taken the more dangerous route from North Africa to Italy. In Libya, people traffickers have operated with relative ease, but many migrants and refugees also set off from Egypt. Merkel said in a weekend newspaper interview she has no regrets about her 2015 decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees and added she will not be deterred from campaigning by angry hecklers. Seeking a fourth term, Merkel has had to contend with loud and sustained heckling on her campaign trail from demonstrators strongly opposed to her refugee policies.

The cell accumulated around 120 canisters of butane gas at a house in a town south of Barcelona with which, police say, it planned to carry out a larger bomb attack. Police believe the cell accidentally ignited the explosives on Aug. 16, the eve of the Barcelona attack, triggering a blast that destroyed the house in the town of Alcanar. The remaining attackers then decided to use hired vans to mow down crowds along Barcelona\u2019s most famous avenue and later mount an assault in the resort town of Cambrils. Moroccan police arrested the man in the city of Casablanca, the source said, without giving further details.  Spain\u2019s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said on Tuesday that Moroccan authorities had arrested two people linked to the attacks but declined to give details about them. Spanish news agency EFE said the second man was arrested in the city of Oujda and was a relative of one of the members of the Barcelona cell. The source did not confirm that. Zoido, speaking after a meeting with the Moroccan interior minister in Morocco\u2019s capital Rabat, said Spanish and Moroccan authorities were working closely together in the investigation.  Most of the suspected attackers were Moroccan and an imam suspected of radicalizing the cell traveled there shortly before the attack took place. Six of the attackers were shot dead by police and two died in the explosion at the house in Alcanar. Four other people were arrested over the assaults, two of whom have now been released under certain conditions.

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Libya\u2019s U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, as part of a deal backed by Italy, was paying militias and giving them equipment and boats to prevent migrant vessels setting off. \u201cThe foreign ministry firmly denies that there is an agreement between Libyan traffickers and the Italian government,\u201d an official from the Italian ministry\u2019s press office said. \u201cThe Italian government does not deal with traffickers\u201d, the official added. A new force in the Libyan coastal town of Sabratha is preventing people leaving, often by locking them up, sources in the area have told Reuters, prompting a sudden drop in departures at what is usually the busiest time of year for migration. Arrivals from North Africa dropped by more than 50 percent in July and more than 80 percent so far in August. Some 600,000 have made it to southern Italy by sea since 2014. In a bid to manage migrant arrivals ahead of a national election due by May next year, Italy has taken action including providing training and equipment to Libya\u2019s coastguard, and laying down rules for non-governmental sea rescue organizations. Progress in Libya is likely to be fragile, as two governments are vying for power, and local militias are battling over territory and smuggling profits.
