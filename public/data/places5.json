Trump, who has called the pact an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated\u201d, has been weighing whether it serves U.S. security interests as he faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks.  The agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the Middle East, she added.\u00a0 \u201cWe hope that the comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing. Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy. If Trump declines to certify Iran\u2019s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement. The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has worried some U.S. allies. China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Tehran, and was also instrumental in pushing through the landmark 2015 deal.

Anti-Vietnamese sentiment is widespread in Cambodia and has often been used as a tool by opponents of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who came to power during Vietnam\u2019s occupation of Cambodia after it drove out the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. Vietnam\u2019s Foreign Ministry hopes Cambodia will take appropriate measures to guarantee the legal and legitimate rights of ethnic Vietnamese in the country, ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that while people are waiting for their legal documents to be completed, they will be able to maintain a stable life and continue contributing to Cambodia\u2019s socio-economic development,\u201d she added. Last week Cambodian immigration authorities said they would seize documents issued improperly to 70,000 people, most of them ethnic Vietnamese, but they have not threatened their forcible removal. Responding to Vietnam, Cambodia vowed to ensure respect for legal and human rights in its enforcement of immigration laws.  \u201cWe won\u2019t enforce it like the one done by the Pol Pot regime,\u201d said Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak, referring to the leader of the Khmer Rouge movement responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.8 million Cambodians in the 1970s, and which targeted Vietnamese, among other groups. Ethnic Vietnamese have settled in what is now Cambodia for hundreds of years, particularly during the 19th and 20th century period when both were part of French possessions overseas. More arrived when Vietnam occupied Cambodia after ousting the Khmer Rouge and before the 1990 withdrawal of its forces. Political tension has been rising in Cambodia ahead of a general election next year in which Prime Minister Hun Sen aims to extend his 32-year rule. The arrest of his main rival and a threat to ban the main opposition party have provoked Western condemnation. ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [105.49034117589586, 12.774423975445469]}}},

While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between Iran and six world powers.

Halawa, a student, and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with a host of crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military\u2019s overthrow of Egypt\u2019s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Friday that Halawa was likely to be able to fly home by Monday following his release late on Thursday.  \u201cThis is a great moment for Ibrahim and his family \u2013 a moment for celebration, and a moment for savoring freedom, and I want to wish Ibrahim Halawa and his family all health and happiness for the future,\u201d Coveney said in a separate statement. Egyptian rights activists say they have faced the worst crackdown in their history under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was elected president in 2014, a year after as armed forces commander he led the military\u2019s toppling of Mursi. Halawa was 17 when he was arrested in 2013 with hundreds of others as part of the crackdown on protests. Since then he had been held in pre-trial detention, where he said he was regularly tortured. The defendants in the case had all faced the death penalty but none received it, though hundreds were given sometimes hefty jail sentences. Rights groups welcomed Halawa\u2019s release. \u201cAfter four years of unjust detention, today Ibrahim Halawa finally walks free.

Cesare Battisti committed four murders in the 1970s when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism, according to the Italian government. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy. Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court authorized Battisti\u2019s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to Italy because former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010. In a note to the top court, the government\u2019s chief lawyer Grace Mendon\u00e7a argued that extradition was a political decision that only the president could make.  She reminded the court that it had approved Battisti\u2019s extradition in 2009 and asked the justices to reject a habeas corpus writ issued ten days ago by one of its members. Battisti was arrested on Oct. 4 as he tried to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that Brazil\u2019s government was about to revoke his asylum status at Italy\u2019s request. He was freed two days later. Lula\u2019s refusal to extradite Battisti upset relations between Brazil and Italy. Temer, a center-right president who took office when Lula\u2019s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year, decided it was time to remove that thorn.

Both countries have worked hard to improve interaction between their militaries to avoid any miscalculations in areas like the South China Sea where both regularly fly military aircraft and sail warships. But there is deep mistrust, with Beijing having been angered by what it views as provocative U.S. military flights and naval patrols in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, and suspicious of close U.S. defense ties with South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and increasingly India. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. Speaking at a monthly news briefing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said it was happy to see positive developments in military relations with the United States that both countries leaders attached importance to. \u201cLooking to the future, we are willing to work with the U.S. side to respect each other, deepen mutual trust, focus on practical exchanges and cooperation and appropriately manage and control disputes, to continue injecting positive energy in the development of ties,\u201d Ren added.

The mission said in a statement that the peacekeepers\u2019 vehicle struck the explosive device between the northern towns of Tessalit and Aguelhok around 2:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).  MINUSMA spokesman Olivier Salgado later told Radio France Internationale that the soldiers involved were from Chad, which has one of the region\u2019s most effective armies. \u201cI condemn with the greatest energy such abject acts, whose only objective is to destabilize the country and harm the peace process under way in Mali,\u201d said interim mission chief Koen Davidse. The rise of jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - in the arid Sahel has alarmed Western powers like France, which has deployed thousands of troops to the region in response.  Four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighbouring Niger by fighters believed to belong to a local Islamic State affiliate operating out of Mali. Militants have exploited porous borders - particularly between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso - to step up attacks on military and civilian targets, including tourist sites in regional capitals. The G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from those three countries, as well as Chad and Mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations in the coming days.

The killing in 1998 of Norbert Zongo, who published Burkina Faso\u2019s Independent newspaper, became a symbol of repression during Blaise Compaore\u2019s 27-year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.  Before his death, Zongo had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for Francois Compaore, and his killing triggered violent protests. Francois Compaore was arrested at Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport after returning to France from Ivory Coast, where his brother lives in exile, his lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sur said in a statement.  Compaore will appear before a judge within 48 hours, he added. Burkina Faso media said he was held on an arrest warrant issued by that country\u2019s government. His lawyer said only it was an international arrest warrant. French prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment on the case. Sur said the charges were politically motivated by a Burkinabe government unable to get its hands on Blaise Compaore, whom the Ivorian government refuses to extradite despite an international warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1987 murder of former president Thomas Sankara. Burkina Faso\u2019s uprising and subsequent elections raised hopes the country would finally reckon with past crimes, but some activists say the government of current president Roch Marc Christian Kabore has moved too slowly against former regime members, some of whom serve in the new administration. Authorities opened a trial this week against allies of Blaise Compaore accused of leading a failed coup d\u2019etat in 2015, including the alleged mastermind, Compaore\u2019s former spy chief General Gilbert Diendere.

As Mengistu\u2019s representative in the Ethiopian province of Gojjam, Eshetu Alemu is accused of ordering the killing of 75 young prisoners in 1978 and of being responsible for the incarceration and inhumane treatment of more than 200 people. The 63-year-old was born in Ethiopia and came to the Netherlands as an asylum seeker in 1990. He pleaded not guilty on Monday, stating that the prosecutors are accusing the wrong man. An Ethiopian court sentenced the defendant to death, in absentia, in 2007 for his role in what was called the \u201cred terror\u201d, which the communist military junta of Mengistu conducted after the ousting of the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, in 1974, the national prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement. The Ethiopian sentence, however, cannot be carried out in the Netherlands because it does not accept the death penalty, making a new trial the best option to hold him to account, prosecutors said.  The trial, which is based on an investigation by the International Crimes Team of the Dutch national police, is being heard at a Dutch domestic court in The Hague, rather than one of the international tribunals that sit in the city.      The court will this week question the defendant, who has been held in custody in the Netherlands since 2015, and will hear statements from victims - Ethiopians living abroad. It is not yet known when the court will reach a verdict. Mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in the same trial in Ethiopia in 2007 after he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17-year rule.  Mengistu was ousted in 1991 and fled to Zimbabwe, where he still lives. ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [4.88875184066267, 52.472269798610874]}}},

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from \u201cdangerous\u201d heart disease and kidney problems. \u201cHis illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,\u201d Mujahid said in a statement.  \u201cWe have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,\u201d he said. The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages. King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital. Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.  The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.  Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom. Kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members.

Mnuchin\u2019s visit to Doha marked the end of a week-long trip aimed at curbing terrorist financing. There were earlier stops in Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. in May announced the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, a U.S.-Gulf initiative to stem finance to militant groups. Following talks with Qatari officials in Doha, Mnuchen said the two countries had agreed to \u201csubstantially increasing the sharing of information on terrorist financiers,\u201d with \u201cgreater emphasis on charitable and money service business sectors in Qatar,\u201d according to the statement. Qatar is keen to show it is cooperating on counter terrorism nearly five months after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt began a diplomatic and trade boycott of the gas-rich state, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with their arch-foe Iran, allegations Doha denies. Qatar in July signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States to increase cooperation on fighting terrorism finance and was one of six Gulf nations last week to announce sanctions on 13 individuals said to be al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.  Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
