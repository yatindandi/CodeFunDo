North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to six nuclear weapons tests and several long-range missile launches.  The world\u2019s chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague opened an investigation on Sunday into attacks in the besieged, rebel-held Syrian region of eastern Ghouta to determine whether banned munitions had been used, diplomatic sources told Reuters. Syria signed up to the international ban on chemical weapons in 2013, as part of a deal brokered by Moscow to avert U.S. air strikes in retaliation for a nerve gas attack that killed hundreds of people, which Washington blamed on Damascus. In the years that followed, Syria\u2019s declared stockpile of banned poison gasses was destroyed by international monitors.

While Trump\u2019s remarks came after a U.S. official told him cocaine was mainly coming from Colombia and Peru via Mexico and Central America, Guatemala\u2019s Governance Minister Enrique Antonio Degenhart Asturias said: \u201cWe know they are not talking about us.\u201d Defense Minister Luis Ralda agreed. \u201cHe knows that we\u2019re giving here a pretty strong fight against drugs and that we\u2019re doing it with the resources we have and with the aid we receive from the different agencies of the United States,\u201d he said.  Asturias and Ralda took Haley to a Guatemalan Naval Special Forces base on the country\u2019s Pacific coast on Thursday to hear about the maritime interdiction operations carried out by the  Guatemalan forces, usually acting on U.S. intelligence tips. Both ministers said more helicopters, boats, vehicles and communication equipment were needed to boost the effectiveness of the operations by the 131-member special force, which seized more than 10,000 packages of cocaine last year valued at nearly $140 million. However, senior Guatemalan naval officers said the force was operating with boats that were not big enough and not always fast enough to catch the drug traffickers. They said the traffickers were traveling thousands of miles from Colombia and had started using hard-to-detect semi-submarine-like boats. The officials said the special forces boats sometimes have to travel hundreds of miles out to sea and end up running out of fuel. They have to rely on fuel from the interdicted vessel to get home or sometimes float until they are rescued.  \u201cWe need a logistics vessel that can allow us to be more successful operationally,\u201d one Guatemalan official told Haley as they toured the special forces base, before being taken out on one of the boats provided several years ago by the United States. Haley also visited Honduras during her four-day trip to Central America and said she plans to brief Trump on her return about their efforts to fight drug and migrant trafficking and corruption. She thanked both countries for their support in voting against a United Nations General Assembly resolution in December that called for Washington to reverse its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.

In an interview with CNN conducted in Pyongyang in January 2016, Kim said he was arrested in October 2015 after spying on behalf of what he called \u201cSouth Korean conservative elements\u201d who approached him while he was working at a trading business in Rason, a city in northern North Korea near the Chinese border. A North Korean defector later said she had met Kim in the United States and that he had told church gatherings he was a missionary helping North Koreans. - Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, spent a month teaching accounting at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was detained at Pyongyang International Airport in April 2017 while trying to leave the country. The university\u2019s chancellor said the arrest was not connected to PUST and that Kim, 59, had been involved with other activities, including helping an orphanage. North Korean state media reported that he was arrested for committing \u201chostile acts\u201d against the government. * Kim Hak Song, thought to be 55, also taught at PUST, which was founded by evangelical Christians and opened in 2010. The university\u2019s co-founder said that Kim, who managed the school\u2019s experimental farm at the college of agriculture and life sciences, was detained in May while traveling on a train from Pyongyang to the Chinese border town of Dandong. In February 2015, Kim wrote in a fundraising post on the website of a Korean-Brazilian church that he was a Christian missionary devoted to helping North Korea\u2019s people learn to be self-sufficient. North Korean state media said he also was arrested on suspicion of committing \u201chostile acts\u201d against the government.

This incensed Palestinians and other U.S. allies. The administration is also putting the final touches on a Middle East peace plan, and U.S. officials said the conference was integral to future negotiations.  \u201cFixing Gaza is necessary to achieve a peace agreement,\u201d one of the senior administration officials said. The officials stressed that the multi-nation humanitarian and reconstruction effort remains in beginning stages. Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump who is overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian peace-process for the White House, gave a two-hour presentation to the attending countries, officials said, but the potential U.S. peace plan was not addressed.  Attendees included representatives from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several European nations. The format did not allow for direct discussions between Israel and the Arab states, officials said.  Potential electricity, water, sewage, and health projects were discussed, but officials declined to outline specific proposals. A senior administration insisted that many projects could be implemented without assistance of the Palestinian Authority, but the goal was to have it ultimately engage in the multi-lateral process. Gaza faces a 43.6 unemployment rate, and many in Gaza blame Israel for the hardships, accusing it of placing an economic blockade on the enclave that has drastically reduced movement of people and goods. But Gazans also fault their own leaders, complaining of a power struggle between Hamas, the armed group that seized military power in Gaza in 2007, and Fatah, the secular party of Western-backed Palestinian President Abbas. Israel, which pulled its settlers and soldiers out of Gaza in 2005, says it has been forced to control access to and from the territory to prevent Hamas from sending out gunmen and bombers, and from smuggling in weapons or material to make them. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, escaped an apparent assassination attempt in Gaza on Tuesday, when a bomb struck his convoy. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement in October that called for the Islamist group to hand administrative control of Gaza to the Authority, but it remains to be fully implemented.

Ahmed Hamed was part of a group that crossed illegally into Hungary on Sept. 16, 2015 and also spoke to the crowd using a loudspeaker before hundreds of migrants forced open the border gate and police fired water cannon and teargas. A Reuters photographer in the courtroom in the southern Hungarian town of Szeged said the handcuffed man, who was also chained around his ankles and guarded by masked police, received the sentence calmly. \u201cWe did not go to the border to cause problems,\u201d Hamed was quoted as saying by local news website Index. \u201cNeither my culture, nor my religion would encourage that.\u201d Hamed\u2019s lawyer was not immediately available for comment. The court will issue a statement later on Wednesday. It was not clear when the court would issue its final verdict in the case. As the holder of a Cypriot passport and therefore a citizen of the European Union, Hamed would be allowed to enter Hungary without a visa, but he was helping relatives and other Syrian citizens, MTI cited his lawyer as saying during the trial. Nearly half of the more than one million migrants who surged into the European Union in 2015 passed through Hungary, often causing chaos at borders and along major highways. Orban\u2019s rightwing nationalist Fidesz party has strongly opposed EU quotas to share out the mostly Muslim migrants across the bloc and says they pose a threat to Western values and culture. Orban called Hamed a \u201cterrorist\u201d last June. Orban\u2019s tough stance on migration has helped shore up support for Fidesz among voters but it has drawn accusations of racism from the United Nations human rights chief.

Prime Minister Theresa May has said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d Russia was behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military.

Braithwaite listed a string of complaints against Russia, echoed by others including the United States. \u201cFrom Ukraine to Syria, and now the United Kingdom, Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the lives of those living within their borders,\u201d said Jason Mack, a first secretary at the U.S. mission in Geneva.

Prosecutor Richard Horwell told a jury at London\u2019s Old Bailey criminal court that after killing Lionnet, the pair had planned to dispose of her body by cremating it in the garden of their flat in the well-to-do Wimbledon area of south London.  They planned to explain her disappearance by saying she had left their employment under a cloud and as far as they knew had returned to France.  But Horwell said the \u201cwicked plan\u201d was frustrated by a neighbor who became concerned about the fire. Firefighters were called and found Lionnet\u2019s remains under the ashes.  Horwell said that during Lionnet\u2019s time in the Wimbledon flat, she had not been paid, had been beaten, and had not been given enough to eat.  Kouider had made a series of accusations against the young nanny, including that she was colluding with the father of one of the children to allow him to sexually abuse the family.  \u201cSophie had a great desire to please, even in adversity, and if she did not have the strength to walk out of this horrendous household, as she plainly did not, she must have found this increasingly toxic situation wholly outside her experience and ability to manage,\u201d Horwell said.  Horwell said none of the accusations were true, but Lionnet was so badly treated and so weak that she sometimes made confessions.

Falcon says he is a natural transition candidate with appeal to a majority fed up with political polarization and economic chaos, and some polls have put him ahead of Maduro.  But the government is linking loyalty at the ballot box to welfare handouts, including a food bag many poor Venezuelans rely on, and benefits from a compliant election board accused of fraud in two recent elections.  During an event at Falcon\u2019s \u201cNational Salvation\u201d campaign headquarters in Caracas, his economic policy adviser Francisco Rodriguez said adults would receive a \u201csolidarity card\u201d giving them $25 a month, and children $10, under their new government. Venezuela has for 15 years maintained currency controls that make it difficult to obtain foreign exchange and prohibit merchants from charging in U.S. currency. A black market does exist, however, where one dollar goes for 231,000 bolivars.   Falcon proposes abandoning the increasingly worthless bolivar in favor of the dollar to attack hyper-inflation. \u201cToday our future begins,\u201d Rodriguez, a Wall Street economist, told a rally to present Falcon\u2019s campaign team.  \u201cWe find ourselves in a ruined nation.

Falcon\u2019s populist \u201csolidarity card\u201d mirrors an existing \u201cfatherland card\u201d set up by the Maduro government, through which Venezuelans can access welfare programs and sometimes cash giveaways.

A test determined that his DNA matched that found near the site where a 19-year-old German female student had died in the southwestern city of Freiburg two months earlier. A police autopsy found she had been a victim of sexual crime and violence before she drowned in a river. In January, a government-sponsored study found that violent crime rose by about 10 percent in 2015 and 2016, and more than 90 percent of the rise was attributed to young male refugees, adding fuel to a political debate over the handling of the migrant crisis.  Fears about security and the assimilation of migrants helped pave the way for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) to win third place in an election last September, and it has now become the official opposition in parliament.  The Afghan man, identified only as Hussein K. under reporting rules, was sentenced to life in prison and preventative detention thereafter, the court in Freiburg said, meaning he will never walk free in public. He had been convicted of attempted murder in Greece in 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in jail, but he was released in 2015 on parole and fled to Germany. The German court sentenced Hussein, who was allegedly 17 years-old when he committed the crime, as an adult, not as a minor, after it concluded with experts that he was an adult at the time of the offense. \u201cAfter an overall assessment of the personality of the defendant and the environmental conditions, the Chamber has come to the conclusion that his mental and moral development is no longer equal to a young person,\u201d the court said. In January, a fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old German girl by a suspect identified by police as her former boyfriend, an Afghan migrant, fueled a debate about verifying the ages of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Germany.
