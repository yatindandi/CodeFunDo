GEM TV founder Saeed Karimian and an associate were driving in Istanbul\u2019s Maslak neighborhood after 8 p.m. (1.00 p.m. ET) on Saturday when their car was blocked by a jeep and shots were fired, Dogan said. Karimian was found dead by emergency services arriving at the scene, Dogan said. His associate was taken to hospital but could not be revived. Dogan described both victims as being of Iranian origin. The Hurriyet Daily News identified Karimian as a British national and his associate as a Kuwaiti. Two masked shooters got out of the jeep before opening fire, Hurriyet said. The jeep was later found abandoned and burned. Istanbul police declined to comment on the shooting when contacted by Reuters. Dogan quoted the mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Sariyer district as saying initial police findings suggested the shooting may have prompted by a financial disagreement involving Karimian. GEM TV is known for entertainment satellite channels that dub foreign films and Western television programs into Farsi for Iranians. It also produces movies and TV series.

The death of 47-year-old Nguyen The Huan, also known as Nguyen The Hung, was the 13th in Japan\u2019s immigration detention system since 2006, a toll that has provoked criticism about conditions inside. For a week before his death, Nguyen had been groaning and complaining of headaches and neck pain, according to a report by the East Japan Immigration Centre reviewed by Reuters, and was moved to a solitary cell for monitoring. Guards heard him groaning through an intercom on March 24 and checked on him. They saw him lying on the ground, seemingly asleep. After six hours, when guards noticed that his posture\u00a0hadn\u2019t changed, they entered the room to find him unconscious and not breathing. They began CPR and called an ambulance. The previously unreported details show Nguyen died under similar circumstances to a 2014 death of a Sri Lankan detainee. A Reuters investigation of that case found that guards did not call an ambulance until hours after the detainee suffered a heart attack because they had thought he was asleep. \u201cThis death is the same (as the Sri Lankan\u2019s). They both died because they were left alone,\u201d said a member of the watchdog who had read the internal report. \u201cThe guards haven\u2019t learned.\u201d  The member, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the case, said there should be a system for monitoring the vital signs of ill detainees around the clock and that guards should at least call on sick detainees to see if they are all right. Daisuke Akinaga, an official at the East Japan Immigration Centre, declined to comment on the details of Nguyen\u2019s death but said the center did not think there were problems with how it responded. He added that the justice ministry was investigating. The ministry said it could not comment on the center\u2019s response as the investigation was ongoing. In April, a full-time doctor began working at the East Japan center on weekdays, though there is still no doctor on site around the clock. Guards received emergency medical training twice a year, Akinaga added.  Nguyen came to Japan in the 1990s to seek asylum, a Vietnamese nun had told Reuters. He was held for overstaying his visa and for a drug offense, the report said.

Saeed was placed under house arrest in January after years of living free in Pakistan, a sore point in the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. His freedom had also infuriated Islamabad\u2019s arch-foe India. The U.S. had offered $10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Saeed, who heads the Muslim charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Washington says JuD is a front for the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, a spokesman for the provincial Punjab government, said the regional administration decided on Sunday to extent the restrictions on Saeed, but did not specify the reasons why. \u201cHafiz Saeed\u2019s house arrest, which ended Sunday night, has been extended for another three months,\u201d Khan said. Saeed could not be reached for comment. The Mumbai attacks in 2008, when 10 gunmen swarmed across  targets including two luxury hotels, a Jewish center and a train station in a rampage that lasted several days, brought Pakistan and India to the brink of war. India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the attacks through LeT, which Saeed founded in the 1990s. Pakistan has denied any state involvement and Saeed - who has distanced himself from LeT - has said repeatedly he was not responsible. Previous Pakistani announcements of action against anti-India militant groups have rarely led to serious punishments for them.  Western countries have for decades accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups and using them as proxies against bigger neighbor India, with whom it has fought three wars since independence. Islamabad denies having such a policy.

Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, 26, who was on a U.S. list of global militants, was the alleged mastermind behind a grenade attack on a Kuala Lumpur bar last June which injured eight people.

Police had earlier cast doubt on the reports, saying that it was possible Muhammad Wanndy had faked his own death. Born and raised in the west Malaysian state of Malacca, Muhammad Wanndy left for Raqqa with his wife in 2014. He first drew public attention the following year when he appeared in a video showing the beheading of a Syrian man. Using the name Abu Hamzah Al Fateh, he quickly made a name for himself as an Islamic State online recruiter and fundraiser.   Statistics from the police counter-terrorism unit show that at least a third of the more than 250 people arrested for Islamic State-linked activities in Malaysia between 2013 and 2016 were recruited by or linked to Muhammad Wanndy.

The cooperation between the two countries comes as China seeks to drum up Western help in a campaign dubbed \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d to track down corruption suspects who have fled overseas. Businessman William Yan last year struck a deal with police to forfeit a record NZ$42 million ($29 million) in assets allegedly obtained through fraud in China, but did not admit guilt at the time. He pleaded guilty on Wednesday in Auckland District Court. Home detention is the New Zealand equivalent of house arrest. China has been pushing for extradition treaties with various countries but many Western nations have been reluctant to help, not wanting to send people to a country where rights groups say mistreatment of suspects is a concern. Yan is on China\u2019s list of top 100 most-wanted international fugitives and New Zealand Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Hamilton said in a statement that the case showed the effectiveness of New Zealand\u2019s relationship with Chinese law enforcement agencies. \u201cIt demonstrates we have the legislation and investigative capability to hold those to account who profit from offending overseas, even when they are living in New Zealand,\u201d Hamilton said.

Over the past months, however, the government has failed to bring Dostum in for questioning and the standoff has become something of a stalemate, leading to increased speculation that Dostum would be forced into exile in Turkey instead.

Police rescued the Russian, identified as Aleksei Makeev, after the crowd stormed his apartment on Friday night, said Guillermo Brahms, secretary general of Benito Juarez municipality, which encompasses Cancun.

The incident began when a group of people confronted Makeev over his disparaging comments toward locals, many of which he videotaped and posted online. Makeev stabbed a youth who got into his apartment, prompting the mob to grow and the violence to escalate, Brahms said. The youth later died of his injuries. Makeev, who was taken to hospital for treatment, is being held there under protective custody, the official said. Authorities said Makeev made videos of himself insulting people in public places in Russian, English and Spanish. In some, he spoke against a backdrop of swastikas. It was not clear how long Makeev had been in Mexico, but Aquaworld, a company offering maritime tours in Cancun, said in a statement on Facebook the Russian had been dismissed from its payroll in November 2015 because of his aggressive behavior. Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute said in separate statement that multiple complaints had been filed against Makeev because of his behavior and that it was seeking the cooperation of Russian authorities to deport him.

In his workshop in Cairo\u2019s Imbaba neighborhood, Mohamed Gamal affixes acrylic portraits of Egyptian footballers, pop stars and presidents to the lanterns, known locally as fawanees. He hopes his modern take on the traditional wooden lanterns believed to date back to Egypt\u2019s 12th-century Fatimid dynasty will stop them from being undercut by new Chinese imports. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with lanterns for 10 years and wooden lanterns have been the most popular during this time. I wanted to do something different,\u201d said Gamal. Chinese products have flooded Middle Eastern markets for years but are becoming increasingly popular in Egypt, where ordinary people and businesses like Gamal\u2019s are struggling amid rampant inflation.  Import-dependent Egypt floated its currency in November, roughly halving the pound\u2019s value. It now hopes the cheaper currency will encourage local manufacturers like Gamal to make products that can replace more expensive imports, narrowing its gaping trade deficit. The arrival in Cairo\u2019s shops last year of battery-powered Chinese lanterns touched a nerve among Egyptians who view the old candle lanterns as a symbol of national pride.  Following an outcry on social media about the dying handicraft, Egypt\u2019s ministry of industry and trade issued a rare decree in 2015 banning imports of Chinese-made lanterns and other traditional Egyptian handicrafts. But rows of the plastic knock-offs flash in the windows of stores near Gamal\u2019s workshop.  \u201cAll of the lanterns in the market, of course, are made in China, so my hope is for us to stop importing them,\u201d said Gamal. \u201cIn fact, my dream is for us one day to export our lanterns to China.\u201d  ", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-ramadan-egypt-custom-lantern/cairo-lantern-maker-champions-old-craft-against-chinese-imports-idUSKBN18H0XG", "title": "22-05-2017 : Cairo lantern-maker champions old craft against Chinese imports (Egypt-China)", "geometry": {"coordinates": [32.09332361313943, 31.074229981343848]}, "src": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170521&t=2&i=1185632769&w=1200&r=LYNXMPED4K0RH", "relation": 0.327, "countries": ["Egypt", "China"], "tags": ["China,Egypt,MOHAMED GAMAL,US,RELIGION,RAMADAN,EGYPT,CUSTOM,LANTERNS,Egypt,International Trade,Islam,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Base Metals,China (PRC),Economic Events,Asia / Pacific,Middle East,Religion / Belief,Emerging Market Countries"]},

They opened fire at close range, killing 29 and wounding 24 in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Speaking at a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Shoukry said the attack on the Christians proved that Libyan militants were capable of targeting Egypt. \u201cThe tragic work in Minya is evidence of the extent to which these groups, which are determined to commit these horrific crimes, can target the innocent in order to destabilise Egypt,\u201d Shoukry said. \u201c(Egypt) targeted the bases of these organisations in order to get rid of them and to limit their ability to threaten Egypt\u2019s national security.
