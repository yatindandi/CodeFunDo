Graft accusations in more than 100,000 leaked documents and e-mails last week heaped more pressure on the scandal-plagued Zuma only days after he survived a no-confidence vote by members of his own party\u2019s top body. South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper reported that several independent sources had told it that the Gupta family had bought Zuma a retirement home for 330 million rand ($25 million) in an upmarket suburb of Dubai. The newspaper did not name the sources, but said they included businessmen, senior officials in the ruling African National Congress and people close to the Zuma family. It also cited some of the leaked e-mails. The Gupta family, wealthy Indian-born businessmen whose companies have contracts with state-owned firms, have denied all allegations of influence-peddling or improper dealings and through a spokesman last week labeled the e-mails \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cPresident Zuma does not own any property outside South Africa and has not requested anybody to buy property for him abroad,\u201d his office said in a statement, adding that the report about a \u201cpalace\u201d in Dubai was a \u201cfabrication\u201d. \u201cThe president has also not received or seen the reported emails and has no knowledge of them,\u201d his office said. South Africa\u2019s anti-graft watchdog called in November for a judge to investigate alleged influence peddling in Zuma\u2019s government and focused on allegations that the brothers, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, influenced appointments of ministers. Zuma is fighting the report in court and has not appointed a judicial commission to investigate. He denies any wrongdoing. Last year, South Africa\u2019s top court found that Zuma had failed to uphold the constitution by ignoring instructions to pay back some of the $16 million in state funds spent on renovations at his private home.

It is appointed by a parliament that also sits in the east and is aligned with powerful military commander Khalifa Haftar. They have spurned a U.N.-backed, internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli.   The eastern-based government\u2019s announcement came after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Dayri gave no immediate explanation for the Libyan move. Regional powers have sided with opposing camps that have vied for power in Libya since the 2011 uprising that toppled veteran strongman leader Muammar Gaddafi. Egypt and the UAE are considered key supporters of Haftar, who has built his position battling Islamist militants and other opponents in eastern Libya. East Libyan authorities accuse Qatar of backing rival, Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya. Haftar\u2019s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) has gained ground in central and southern Libya since last year, taking control of oil facilities and military bases. Most recently they have advanced near oasis towns in the Jufra and Sabha regions. ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [51.06359252092993, 25.307366877458804]}}},

The base was in the Middle Juba region in southern Somalia, the office of Somalia\u2019s President Mohamed Abdullahi said.  \u201cEarlier today, I authorised our special forces with the support of our international partners to conduct a strike against an al Shabaab training camp near Sakow,\u201d his statement said.  \u201cThis was a successful strike that destroyed a key al Shabaab command and supply hub. This will ultimately disrupt the enemy\u2019s ability to conduct new attacks within Somalia.\u201d There was no immediate comment from al Shabaab. On Thursday, al Shabaab killed 59 people in an attack on a military base in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in northern Somalia. Since being pushed out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011, al Shabaab has lost control of most of Somalia\u2019s cities and towns. But it still retains a strong presence in swathes of the south and center and still carries out major gun and bomb attacks.     The group aims to topple Somalia\u2019s government, drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law.

They said the (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems -  HIMARS - had moved into the desert garrison, which has seen a buildup in recent weeks as tensions escalate after the U.S.-led coalition struck Iranian-backed forces to prevent them advancing toward the Tanf base. \u201cThey have arrived now in Tanf and they are a significant boost to the U.S. military presence there,\u201d one senior intelligence source said, without elaborating. The HIMARS had already been deployed in northern Syria with U.S.-backed forces battling Islamic State militants, he added.  Washington deployed the HIMARS on the Turkish border to strike at Islamic State outposts. They were used several times from the Jordanian border to hit militants who had a foothold in the southeastern desert.  Under heavy pressure, the militants have mostly retreated from the desert in the last three months. Now U.S.-backed Syrian rebels are competing with the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias as they all try to recapture territory from Islamic State.  Tanf is near a Syria-Iraq border crossing on the main Baghdad-Damascus highway. The rebels took it from Islamic State last year, partly to stop Iran from using it to send arms to the Syrian government.

Former Prime Minister John Major warned this week that May\u2019s plan to govern with the support of the DUP risked convincing \u2018hard men\u2019 on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland to return to violence. A deal with the DUP would increase the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. Sturgeon also declined to say whether or not she would back down on her push to hold another Scottish independence referendum, which appeared to have eroded support for her party in last week\u2019s national election.

Laos\u2019 Xaysomboun region has been plagued by sporadic conflict between the government and ethnic Hmong rebels for years. Two Chinese people, including an employee of a mining company, were killed in a suspected bomb blast on a vehicle in the region in January 2016.   In March 2016, one Chinese worker was killed and several injured in an attack on a company with Chinese investment in Luang Prabang province. China has been vying for influence in Laos, providing loans, aid and infrastructure investment.

May, who lost her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election, is seeking backing from the Democratic Unionist Party and its 10 lawmakers to get legislation through parliament, including the bills needed to enact Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU.  Some political leaders in Northern Ireland fear a tie-up between the two could unsettle politics in Britain\u2019s smallest province, where pro-British unionists share power with Irish nationalists following a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence. Varadkar, at a news conference with May in Downing Street, said both the British and Irish governments needed to be impartial actors in relation to Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing arrangements, which are currently stalled.  \u201cI was very much reassured by what the prime minister had to say that the agreement, once it\u2019s reached, would be published so it would be there for everyone to see,\u201d he said.   \u201cWe spoke about the very important need for both governments to be impartial actors when it comes to Northern Ireland, and also that we are co-guarantors to the Good Friday Agreement and that any agreement that may exist between the Conservative Party and the DUP should not in any way impact on the Good Friday Agreement.  \u201cI was very reassured by the prime minister (who) said to me today that would be the case.\u201d May, who said that talks with the DUP were ongoing, and Varadkar also reiterated that they wanted the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to be as seamless as possible once Britain has left the EU.  The border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, will become the only land frontier between the UK and the EU after Britain exits the bloc in March 2019. At a separate briefing in Belfast, Simon Hamilton, a senior DUP member of the Northern Irish Assembly, said discussions were ongoing in London. \u201cThey will take as long as they take,\u201d he told reporters, when asked if they could be completed by this week.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday.  The 15-member council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys and members had until Tuesday evening to raise any objections. There were none, diplomats said.     The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been \u201cunfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.\u201d Guterres described the U.S. rejection as \u201ca loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.\u201d Following that objection, Russia and other council members then rejected a British candidate and an American candidate, said diplomats. Kobler\u2019s posting was briefly extended until the end of June.  Libya slid into turmoil after the 2011 overthrow of ruler Muammar Gaddafi, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. The U.N. envoy to Libya has been trying to broker peace. The political chaos and security vacuum has allowed Islamist militant groups to gain a foothold and human traffickers to thrive. Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [17.22976157115812, 26.403169814835515]}}},

We will start a serious long, patient process (of dialogue) with Baghdad,\u201d he added.

Guy Philippe, 49, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga in Miami after pleading guilty to conspiring to commit money laundering in connection with his receipt of cash payments tied to narcotics sales in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Prosecutors said Philippe, a former high-ranking official in the Haitian National Police, received more than $1.5 million in bribes to ensure the safe transit of drug shipments. His sentence was confirmed by court records. Philippe has been in custody since his arrest early this year. A lawyer for Philippe did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Philippe pleaded guilty in April as part of a deal in which two counts were dismissed against him, including one for drug trafficking that could have resulted in a life sentence, and in which the parties agreed to recommend a nine-year prison term. He was arrested in Haiti on Jan. 5 in Haiti after giving a radio interview and then extradited to the United States. He had avoided capture for more than a decade in connection with a November 2005 indictment. The arrest came four days before Philippe was scheduled to join Haiti\u2019s parliament as a senator, following his November election from the country\u2019s southwestern Grand Anse region. U.S. prosecutors accused Philippe of conspiring from 1997 to March 2001 to import more than 5 kg (11 pounds) of cocaine into the United States, and to launder money to conceal illegal activity from June 1999 to April 2003. He was also accused of having transferred a $112,000 check that included sums from drug trafficking in late 2000. ", "end": {"geometry": {"coordinates": [-95.08316236080748, 41.23030059884272]}}},

Turkish defense ministry sources said U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also promised his Turkish counterpart to provide a monthly list of weapons handed to the YPG, saying the first inventory had already been sent to Ankara. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK, which has been waging an insurgency in the country\u2019s southeast since the mid-1980s. It has said supplies to the YPG have in the past ended up in PKK hands, and described any weapon given to the force as a threat to its security. The United States sees the YPG as an essential ally in the campaign to defeat Islamic State in Raqqa, the jihadists\u2019 main urban base in Syria. The fight for Raqqa was launched two weeks ago, piling pressure on Islamic State which also faces defeat in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul. Mattis told Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik that a detailed record of all equipment provided to the YPG was being kept and that all the weapons would be taken back after Islamic State was defeated, the sources said. In a letter to the minister, Mattis also said that Arab fighters would form 80 percent of the forces which will recapture Raqqa. Once the mainly Sunni Arab city was taken, it would be held by Arab forces, the sources said he told Isik. Relations between the NATO allies have been strained by President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to arm the YPG, despite protests from President Tayyip Erdogan who set out Turkey\u2019s objections at a White House meeting last month. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the YPG if it felt it was threatened by the group. A Syrian war monitor and Kurdish sources said on Wednesday that Turkey had sent military reinforcements including troops, vehicles and equipment into an area of northern Syria where it has been fighting Islamic State and YPG forces. Turkish officials have not commented, but the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish reinforcements headed south of Azaz town, which is held by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and is close YPG-controlled territory.
